Listen to the full episode of A Cold Wet Tuesday Night and more Stoke City content on BBC Sounds. Mark ElliottBBC Radio Stoke commentator Robert Bozenik did not even need to think when asked what he needs to do to take his game to the next level. \"Goals, goals, goals,\" was the reply. Making a rare start for Stoke in place of the rested Divin Mubama, Bozenik was singled out by his manager Mark Robins for praise despite leaving Tuesday's3-0 win over Charltonwithout adding his name to the scoresheet. He came close, firing just wide from the edge of the box in the second half but his work-rate and hold up play were superb. Bozenik has never been prolific but has been working with Robins - a former forward himself - to improve his strike-rate. Off the pitch, he says he has settled in well, sharing a commute with international team-mate Tomas Rigo from an area they both share with Burnley goalkeeper and fellow Slovakian Martin Dubravka. On it, against Charlton he showed he can offer plenty to Stoke's season. They have long had competition for places all over the pitch and Tatsuki Seko, Steven Nzonzi and Eric Bocat came in as Robins made four changes to his side and did well. That has helped put them in a great position in theChampionship tableand now for the first time since arriving from Boavista in the summer, Bozenik has had a big part to play in a significant game. With Mubama, the fit-again Sam Gallagher and Bozenik to choose from, Robins has options in the one area that had looked light. Stoke have genuine depth and a real chance at getting themselves to January in a position to make a run at promotion to the Premier League. This video can not be played Listen to Mark Robins' post-match interview after Stoke's 3-0 win over Charlton Stoke City boss Mark Robins says his side probably played better in the Championship defeats to Leicester and Coventry than they did in the3-0 win over Charltonon Tuesday night. But the 55-year-old believes the victory was \"well-deserved\" and is delighted the Potters have moved into the automatic promotion spots. \"It probably felt like we were comfortable,\" Robins told BBC Radio Stoke. \"We were in front early after two minutes, followed that up and then we were three-up in the first half. \"They had a real go at us. We kept things simple because that was what got us the goals. \"I think it was well-deserved and just reward, really, because the three performances we have had over the last three games, this, Coventry and Leicester - it probably wasn't our best performance of the three. \"We've ended up getting three goals, conceding none and winning three points.

Here are the key lines from his news conference: Hurzeler said \"all the players who were available last weekend are still available,\" which is \"positive news\". James Milner and Karou Mitoma are \"getting close\" to a return with Hurzeler confident both will be back before Christmas. On opponents Forest: \"Their style of play is quite effective so you have to be switched on for 90 minutes, be strong in set-pieces and be intense. It's a fight. A big battle there. They know how to win games and have very experienced players on the pitch.\" He said Brighton replicate different game scenarios in training, but the reason they are scoring late goals \"is all about mindset and belief in our own quality\". On Baleba going off at half-time against Brentford: \"We try to develop every player. We are trying to get him back to his best level step by step without putting him under pressure. Of course, he wants to play well. Sometimes you need to be patient, other times demanding and ruthless, but it is about creating the right support around him to give him the right help.\" He said Yasin Ayari \"is improving day by day\" and his \"professional work ethic\" is the reason \"he is so important\" to Brighton this season. Brighton midfielder Jack Hinshelwood spoke to the Albion Unlimited podcast about Saturday's goalscoring return against Brentford - his first game in over two months:\"My season probably hasn't got going yet. I was a bit unlucky with the way that the injury panned out againstBournemouth. \"It's been 10 weeks now and I've been grinding away in the background, supporting the boys from every angle and to be back out there amongst it is really amazing and I hope it continues. \"My girlfriend at home is probably as delighted as I am that I'm back playing! It's a lonely place when you're injured. I feel for some of the boys, like Solly [March] and Webby [Adam Webster]. These times are hard so we really have to stick together, but we know when we come back you get moments like this, which make every dark day worth it. \"If we continue showing that character [as against Brentford] going forward, it's going to be an exciting season for us. We've just got to keep this momentum going now and really demand from each other day in, day out and make sure our standards stay high. \"It could be a really exciting period for the rest of the season.\" Listen to Hinshelwood's interview and the rest of the episode on BBC Sounds The latest episode of BBC Radio Sussex's Albion Unlimited podcast has landed.

    "title": "Arne Slot: Liverpool hit 'new low' after PSV defeat but is Dutchman's job at risk?  - BBC Sport",
    "content": "Liverpool have lost three successive games by a margin of three goals for the first time since December 1953 It would have seemed unthinkable six months ago, but Arne Slot's position as Liverpool manager is starting to come under question. A humiliating 4-1 defeat by PSV Eindhoven at Anfield on Wednesday was the Reds' ninth loss in 12 games - their worst run in 71 years. The Dutchman guided Liverpool to their 20th league title in May and spent almost £450m on new talent in the summer, including a British record £125m for Alexander Isak. However, as December approaches the Reds are 12th in the Premier League and 13th in the 36-team league phase of the Champions League. Liverpool are \"not a sacking club\", according to former defender Jamie Carragher - but how much time will Slot be given to turn things around? 'I'm past being angry' - Liverpool in worst run for 71 years The 3-0 defeat by Nottingham Forest at home on Saturday was bad but the loss against PSV was arguably the low point of Liverpool's season. \"Liverpool seem to keep finding ways to hit new lows under Arne Slot, and of course, that is leading to questions around the manager's future,\" Josh Sexton of Liverpool fan group the Anfield Wrap told BBC Sport. \"He will accept that as part of the pressure that comes with such a reputable job, but now the biggest question has become 'is he the right man to actually rescue a team from such a slump?'\" Slot faced the unenviable task of replacing Jurgen Klopp in 2024 but defied expectations by winning the title at a canter last term. That has earned the Dutchman significant credit among Liverpool's fanbase. There is also sympathy for Slot after a tumultuous summer that saw the exits of key players including Trent Alexander-Arnold and Luis Diaz, an influx of new signings and the death of Portugal attacker Diogo Jota. \"I do not mind giving him the chance to have a go [at fixing this],\" Sexton said. \"I just think, given what he achieved in such a short space of time and how that had this team so far ahead of their timeline, his bosses should keep the faith that he can get back on that road - back to where we belong.\" Liverpool cruised to the league title in Slot's first season in charge, finishing 10 points clear of second-placed Arsenal. \"If they were to sack him, I would be gutted that the man who brought me such brilliant days watching my team lift the league title last season could not work it out, but I would equally understand and try to trust the decision that had been taken,\" Sexton added. \"I would hold reservations about the people sacking him being the same ones involved in the decision-making that led to such an imbalanced squad as it is at present. \"But if I did not trust the process, there would be no point in any of this, really, would there?\" Speaking after the PSV defeat, Slot said his job was not under threat but he did understand why there was growing noise about his position. \"I am feeling safe, I am OK, I have got a lot of support from above,\" he said. \"It would be nice to turn it around and get a victory of course but if you are working as a coach and not doing well then it is normal that questions are asked. \"I am OK with my position. It is not the first time I've been in a difficult position but it is about time that we turned it around.\" Liverpool's next three fixtures offer Slot a promising opportunity to right the ship, starting with a trip to 17th-placed West Ham on Sunday before matches against promoted sides Sunderland and Leeds. Asked about his conversations with the Liverpool hierarchy, Slot added: \"We talk a lot. They are helpful to the team and to me and we have those conversations but they don't call me every single minute of the day to say they trust me. \"In the normal conversations we have I feel the trust. But I haven't spoken to them after this game yet so let's see.\" This video can not be played Liverpool 'lack of intensity' exposed by PSV Former Reds defender Carragher, who made 736 appearances for the club, said he was frustrated with Liverpool's players. \"I have always been in the camp that you stick with the manager... I'm angry with the players, if I'm totally honest,\" Carragher said on CBS Sports. In the past, Liverpool have tended to show patience with their managers rather than sacking them at the first sign of trouble. \"Liverpool's not a sacking club,\" Carragher added. \"Liverpool are different from almost every club in European football - the manager is the king, the manager gets time. \"But it does get to a stage for any manager at a club where it's untenable. It can't go on any longer. \"I'm not quite there yet, but I know others are.\" Sean: Arne Slot won the league with Jurgen Klopp's side. He ripped it apart in the summer and look where we are now. They look clueless. He has to go, I'm afraid. Mark: Getting silly now. I have no idea where this ends. Slot's got to have until Christmas, but if things don't improve soon then I can't see him being in a job in 2026. The players' confidence has just evaporated. Graham: Stunned to be honest. Another early goal and Liverpool seem to just give up. I have never seen a team make so little effort in a match bar a couple of players. If Liverpool aren't careful, we could be headed for relegation this season. Absolutely shocked. Jan: Woeful. Disorganised. No plan. How much more time will be given to a manager who is lacking any idea on what to do? The players should hang their heads in shame - Dominik Szoboszlai and Hugo Ekitike are honourable exceptions. A dreadful game once more. Paul: No fight and players out of position. The buck stops with Slot and his coaching staff. Same mistakes week in week out. Don't like to see managers get sacked but he looks out of his depth. Need to change it now! Chris: A decade of solid development destroyed in 12 games. Motivation has gone and it is not down to the new players as it's almost every aspect of the team. Dominik Szoboszlai is the standout player and he is out of position. What is going on? Where are the leaders? Where is the effort? Where is the soul? We are very much walking alone. Colin: We only looked good playing fast and direct.

    "content": "Keir Starmer defends the government's tax-raising budget, saying it will help lifthundreds of thousands of children out of poverty From electric vehiclestothe future of pensions, we're answering your questions on the Budget this afternoon Do you have something you want to ask?Get in touch On Wednesday, Rachel Reeves increased taxes for millions, while also ending the two-child benefit cap -here's her Budget at a glance Starmer says the child poverty is \"abhorrent\", and he is \"absolutely determined to keep it down\" The prime minister also defends the government's record on economic growth,after medium-term forecasts were lowered yesterday The Budget means millions will pay higher rates of tax as their pay increases, after Reevesfroze income tax thresholds until 2031- there will also be new taxes on electric cars, pension contributions, and houses worth more than £2m The IFS think tank says households face a \"truly dismal\" rise in their spending power of just0.5% a year over the next five years Edited by Andrew Humphrey and Jamie Whitehead Harry FarleyPolitical correspondent Tom asks: Can anyone define a working family in one sentence? It's a good question. To most people, it's a family where one or two people are working in it. But it gets more complicated when you dissect what politicians mean when they say it. What I think Tom is getting at is Labour's promise to protect working families before the election. For Labour, Tom's question is one of the past. It's obsolete. They've admitted everyone will have to chip in some way - this is the cost of battling the country's child poverty. Whether that's justified is up for you to decide. Dearbail JordanSenior business and economics reporter  Kane asks: Has Reeves restored tax on aviation fuel\nfor private jets? Couldn't the government collect an estimated £2bn in income\nfrom the super-rich instead of asking \"ordinary people to pay a bit\nmore\"? Recent research from climate charity Possible suggests that\nchanging taxes on private jets could raise as much as £2.7bn a year for\ngovernment coffers. It says that the amount of Air Passenger Duty (APD) private\npassengers pay in proportion to the total cost of their flight is lower than\nwhat people shell-out to travel commercially. What's more, no fuel duty is paid\non kerosene for private jets. There was no announcement in the Budget regarding fuel duty\nfor posh planes, but the government has hiked charges these travellers will pay\non long-haul flights from around £253 to £1,141 per flight. At the moment, private jets weighing more than 20 tonnes or\nthat have fewer than 19 seats pay higher tax charges. But from April 2027, that\nwill expand to include private aircraft weighing more than 5.7 tonnes. Marc AshdownBusiness correspondent Clive asks how households can get the £150 off their energy bill that Reeves announced yesterday. That's a difficult one, because it's energy companies that manage our bills. The government contributes with green subsidiaries paid through bills - but these are going to be ramped down. They hope scrapping these green levies will decrease energy bills, as well as the spikes in bills caused by the war in Ukraine over time. This should add up to around £130-150 in the next few years. Ben KingBusiness reporter Cliff asks: So many of\nthe measures do not actually kick in until some years down the line. How\ndoes that cover the black hole that exists today? Excellent\nquestion. There is no \"black hole\" today. The term \"black hole\" is often used\nto refer to the chancellor being on course to miss her fiscal rules. And the\ntwo main rules only look at how the public finances are projected to look in\nthe future - currently the financial year 2029/30. All\nday-to-day spending has to be covered by tax revenue in the official forecasts\nfor that year, in order to meet those rules. So\npencilling in future tax rises helps the chancellor to meet her fiscal rules -\nand thus fill in any so-called \"black holes\" - because those rules are looking\nout into the future too. From freezes on tax thresholds to minimum wage increases,\nthe Budget affects everyone - and it's important to learn how it will impact you.

Kevin PeacheyCost of living correspondent A reader asks: “Can someone please explain more about the change to salary sacrifice pension savings? Is the £2,000 cap on the total paid in by the employee?” This can be quite complicated, and it is worth highlighting that only one in 10 workers in the public sector and three in 10 in the private sector use a pension salary sacrifice arrangement. Income tax relief on pension contributions remains untouched. Under salary sacrifice, workers give up some of their salary with the equivalent being put into their pension. The cap, from 2029, relates to the amount the employee would have put into their pension, not the employers’ contribution. But, with employers facing a larger national insurance bill as a result, they might be less generous in what they put in for their staff, or even how much they pay overall. Tarah WelshHousing correspondent Sean from Penzance says that he was hoping to sell his house and buy in another area but rumours of stamp duty changes caused the market to flatline. What happened to stamp duty in the budget? There were no changes to stamp duty in this Budget. As a reminder, stamp duty is a tax paid by most home buyers in England and Northern Ireland, with Scotland and Wales having similar levies. The current stamp duty rates are: Nikki FoxDisability correspondent Robert, from Tauton, says his wife has an electric car under the Motability scheme to promote independent travel. Willthe announcement of the new mileage tax on electric vehicles be a barrier to taking journeys for her, or is she exempt? The fact EV drivers will soon have to pay 3p a mile certainly made the headlines yesterday - but there was no mention at all about whether disabled people will be exempt from that. We’ve put a call in to Motability and they confirm it just wasn’t made clear in the Budget - so we’re all trying to find out. What you may have missed yesterday - because, indeed, the chancellor did not actually spell it out in her speech - is that she is bringing in some significant changes to the Motability scheme: Not just banning so-called ‘luxury’ cars - which she did mention - but lifting the tax exemption on the insurance included in the lease and adding VAT to the advanced payment a disabled customer may have to pay on a vehicle. I’m sure your wife will have had to make an advanced payment, because EVs are some of the most expensive cars available on the scheme. As you know, that's out of your own pocket. Reducing what the chancellor called these “generous taxpayer subsidies” is the biggest change since Motability was first introduced in the 1970s. And Motability have told us it means the scheme will need to change. They’re not going to take any steps straight away, but they've acknowledged that any increase in the cost of a lease “could have a significant effect on disabled people’s independence and daily life”. So not great news for Motability customers, I’m afraid. Do you have questions related to yesterday's Budget? We're answering your questions this afternoon.

Kevin PeacheyCost of living correspondent Stephanie asks: “How is the increase in wage going to actually help the cost of living? When wages go up businesseswill increase pricesfrom production to sale point.” Stephanie is pointing to the rise in minimum wages. Eligible workers aged 21 and over on the National Living Wage will receive £12.71 an hour, up from £12.21. There are chunky increases for younger workers too. While the extra burden will be faced by businesses, the official forecaster believes the rate of inflation will slow over the next couple of years. Remember, that means prices will still go up, but at a slower rate. Other cost-of-living measures include reducing energy bills by ending certain schemes, and scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Tarah WelshHousing correspondent Lisa says that whilst she doesn't own a mansion, her\nproperty is in band F, and asks if she will end up paying more council tax? Not necessarily, it depends how much Lisa’s home is worth. If it’s valued at more than £2m, then the short answer is\nyes. However, the Treasury says it expects the new surcharge to apply to fewer\nthan 1% of properties in England, and most are expected to be in London. As a reminder, the policy comes into effect in April 2028\nand there will be four price bands, with the surcharge rising from £2,500 for a\nproperty valued in the £2m to £2.5m band, to £7,500 for a property valued in\nthe highest band of £5m or more. Kevin PeacheyCost of living correspondent Tony, from Preston, and Connie, from Truro, ask whether the freeze on tax thresholds will mean the state pension being taxed. In the Budget, the chancellor said that the freeze on tax thresholds would be extended for three years from 2028. A lot more state pensioners might end up paying income tax before that – because the full, new state pension is only just shy of the 20% income tax threshold already. About half of pensioners already pay income tax because they have more income than just the state pension, such as workplace pension payments. There was a slight hint in the Budget that, for those whose pension only just takes them into paying tax, the government might not worry about collecting it – but there is a lot more detail needed for that to become clear.  Jamie WhiteheadLive editor It's just over 24 hours since Chancellor Rachel Reeves delivered the Budget, which froze National Insurance and income tax thresholds for an extra three years, dragging more people into higher bands over time. It also included scrapping the two-child benefit cap from April, a council tax surcharge or \"mansion tax\" on properties in England worth over £2m and a new mileage-basedtax for electric vehiclesand plug-in hybrid cars. There's plenty to digest - and over the next hour or so we'll be answering some of your questions. In the meantime, you can bring yourself up to speed on Reeves's Budget yesterday,with our at-a-glance guide. And if there's something you want answered,you can get in touch here. By Phil Leake and Lucy Dady Rachel Reeves introduced tax measures in yesterday’s\nBudget that are expected to raise an extra £26.1bn in 2029-30, equivalent\nto just over 0.7% of the value of the economy measured by GDP. The move has earned the chancellor a second entry on\nthe list of the UK’s eight most tax-raising budgets in the last 50 years. Former Chancellor Norman Lamont tops the list for his March\n1993 Budget, which was delivered after John Major’s surprise general election\nvictory for the Conservatives in 1992 and contained tax rises equal to just\nover 1.4% of GDP. Reeves’ 2024 Budget is actually second on the\nlist, which included tax measures expected to raise £41.5bn by 2029-30,\nequivalent to around 1.2% of the whole economy, fuelled by an increase in\nemployer National Insurance Contributions. The 2021 Spring Budget, delivered during the Covid\npandemic by then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak, is the third on the\nlist. But Reeves’ latest Budget, which is forecast to raise £26bn\nin taxes in 2029-30, sees her enter the list again. By Gerry Georgieva Chancellor Rachel Reeves has been asked repeatedly about\nNational Insurance hikes since delivering her second Budget yesterday. In response, she has quoted Labour’s pre-election manifesto\nas saying that the party would not increase “the rates” of National Insurance,\nVAT or income tax. She said this yesterday in a post-Budget interview and then\nrepeated it in five of the seven interviews she gave this morning.\nThe problem is that it’s not quite true. Labour’s 2024 election manifesto actually pledged that the\nparty \"will not increase taxes on working people, which is why we will not\nincrease National Insurance, the basic, higher, or additional rates of income\ntax, or VAT\". So for income tax, the party clearly only stated that the\nrates would not be raised, but its pledge seemed to rule out any increase in\nNational Insurance overall. Reeves has now extended a freeze on thresholds - the point\nat which you start paying National Insurance - which means more people will be\npaying it as wages rise. Helen Miller from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an\neconomic research group, says this would \"break the letter of the\nmanifesto which said no increase in National Insurance\". Tax relief for people working from home will end on 6 April\nnext year, according to documents published alongside the Budget. It means that those who work at home will no longer be able\nto claim money back for domestic expenses such as gas, electricity or business\nphone calls. The decision will affect 300,000 people at a cost of £62 a\nyear for basic-rate taxpayers and £124 for individuals on the higher rate. Those who can claim tax relief include people with a job\nwhich requires them to live far away from home or if their employer does not\nhave an office. First Minister John Swinney pledged to not increase income tax rates or introduce new bands The UK Budget dominated First Minister's Questions at\nHolyrood today, where John Swinney insisted the Scottish government will not\nincrease income tax rates or introduce any new bands. The Scottish Conservative leader Russell Findlay accused the\nfirst minister of misleading parliament by falsely claiming to have maintained\nhis 2021 manifesto commitment on income tax. Swinney hit back saying the manifesto had included a\nsentence warning the pledge on income tax was predicated on the economic\ncontext of the time, which was rocked by the Ukraine war and Liz Truss's\nBudget. He also went on to welcome the forthcoming abolition of the\ntwo-child benefit cap claiming it was the SNP that had shamed the Labour\ngovernment into acting. Keir Starmer hasdefended the government's growth recordin an interview with the BBC's Chris Mason, pointing out that the OBR upgraded its 2025 forecast from 1% to 1.5%. But a closer look at the OBR report suggests the upgrade was - at least in part - driven by technical factors unrelated to the government's growth initiatives. The OBR explains that growth was \"stronger than expected\" in the first quarter of the year, partly driven by the \"temporary frontloading of property transactions and exports\". In plain English, that means businesses rushed ahead with exports at the beginning of the year - stockpiling in an effort to beat Donald Trump's tariffs. Those looking to buy a property also rushed to complete their transactions in the first quarter of the year before stamp duty costs went up. The OBR calls these \"temporary\" drivers of growth, which have since \"unwound\". It expects quarterly growth to \"pick up only gradually in the near term\" - a consequence of \"geopolitical uncertainty\" and subdued business and consumer confidence. Explaining why confidence is subdued, it points to “anticipation\nof further tax rises”.  You can read more detail on how young people might be affectedhere. Tony BonsignoreBBC Westminster While Keir Starmer has been speaking to Chris Mason, we've also been hearing from Conservative\nleader Kemi Badenoch. Badenoch tells BBC Radio WM that she believes -unlike the PM- that the decision to lift\nthe two-child benefit cap will lead tomorechildren being pushed into\npoverty. The move, she argues, was being funded \"by taxing people who are also struggling, people who are\nnot on benefits\". She adds:\n\"We do need to tackle child poverty, but we should do so by making sure\nthat their parents have better paying jobs, stop taxing them to the hilt, give\nthem more money in their pockets and actually stop destroying jobs. Rachel\nReeves is doing all of those things in this budget.\" \"So what\nwe're actually going to see is more child poverty as a lot of people are\nnot able to afford the increased cost of living.\" Drama based on Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's fight for justice  A prize-winning author accused of racism  Stories from the 1984 miners' strike  The scale of China's state-backed overseas spending  Copyright © 2025 BBC.

    "title": "Households face 'dismal' rise in spending power, says IFS - BBC News",
    "content": "Households are facing a \"truly dismal\" increase in their disposable income following the Budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank has said. Average disposable income is expected to grow by \"only\" 0.5% a year over the next five years, according to the government''s official forecaster. National Insurance is also set to increase as a result of the cap on salary sacrifice pension payments andthe freezing of tax thresholds, which IFS director Helen Miller said she considered \"a breach of the manifesto\". Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC his party made \"a number of commitments in our manifesto, which we have kept\". Ahead of last year's general election, Labour promised not to increase taxes on \"working people\", including National Insurance, Income Tax and VAT. The prime minister accepted he was asking \"everybody to make a contribution\", which he said was \"fair and necessary\". \"I absolutely wanted to bear down and reduce the cost of living because for most... that will be the single most important thing.\" Ms Miller said the growth in disposable income - which measures the amount of money people have left to spend after taxes have been paid - was disappointing \"especially when compared to the more than 2% per year we achieved across every parliament from the mid-1980s to mid-2000s\". According to the IFS, average disposable income per person is expected to rise by nearly £104 a year for the next four years, under current inflation forecasts. \"Before this Budget, the UK was faced with lacklustre economic growth, stagnating living standards, and a dizzying array of fiscal pressures,\" Ms Miller said. \"The same is still true after this Budget.\" Her comments were backed up by the Resolution Foundation think tank, which predicted that the growth in living standards in this parliament would be the second worst on record. In her Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves chose to extend the freeze on income tax thresholds for a further three years beyond 2028. She also imposed a £2,000-a-year cap on the amount put into pensions from 2029 througha salary sacrifice arrangementbefore National Insurance payments are due. Reeves also denied the Budget broke manifesto pledges but admitted her policies would have \"an impact on working people\". She told the BBC this contribution had been kept \"to a minimum\" because of other changes such as increasing taxes on online gambling, properties worth more than £2m and income from dividends or renting out property.  Live: Latest Budget coverage What the Budget means for you and your money Key points from the Budget at a glance The chancellor also highlighted other measures aimed at cutting the cost of living, including freezing NHS prescription charges and regulated rail fares in England, as well as scrapping green levies added to energy bills. Asked if she would apologise for breaking her promise not to increase taxes on working people, Reeves said she had made \"fair and necessary choices\" to cut NHS waiting lists, lift children out of poverty and reduce the cost of living. In the run-up to the Budget, there was much speculation about the UK's finances and the outlook for the economy, and how the chancellor faced big gaps in meeting her fiscal rules on borrowing, leading to uncertainty in financial markets. Giving her analysis of the Budget, Ms Miller noted how the OBR's \"overall forecast downgrade was minimal\" and there was \"no big fiscal repair job\" to do. In an interview with the BBC, she also said the government appeared to have ignored its stated number one mission to boost economic growth. \"We shouldn't expect every Budget to solve all of our problems, but I think it's reasonable to expect that for a government that makes such a big deal of having growth as its number one mission, they would be doing more to drive up growth,\" she said. Ms Miller said Reeves could have reformed the tax system to boost the economy and that the government also has \"hard yards\" to do in areas such as competition policy, regulation and education.

    "title": "Arne Slot: Liverpool hit 'new low' after PSV defeat but is Dutchman's job at risk?  - BBC Sport",
    "content": "Liverpool have lost three successive games by a margin of three goals for the first time since December 1953 It would have seemed unthinkable six months ago, but Arne Slot's position as Liverpool manager is starting to come under question. A humiliating 4-1 defeat by PSV Eindhoven at Anfield on Wednesday was the Reds' ninth loss in 12 games - their worst run in 71 years. The Dutchman guided Liverpool to their 20th league title in May and spent almost £450m on new talent in the summer, including a British record £125m for Alexander Isak. However, as December approaches the Reds are 12th in the Premier League and 13th in the 36-team league phase of the Champions League. Liverpool are \"not a sacking club\", according to former defender Jamie Carragher - but how much time will Slot be given to turn things around? 'I'm past being angry' - Liverpool in worst run for 71 years The 3-0 defeat by Nottingham Forest at home on Saturday was bad but the loss against PSV was arguably the low point of Liverpool's season. \"Liverpool seem to keep finding ways to hit new lows under Arne Slot, and of course, that is leading to questions around the manager's future,\" Josh Sexton of Liverpool fan group the Anfield Wrap told BBC Sport. \"He will accept that as part of the pressure that comes with such a reputable job, but now the biggest question has become 'is he the right man to actually rescue a team from such a slump?'\" Slot faced the unenviable task of replacing Jurgen Klopp in 2024 but defied expectations by winning the title at a canter last term. That has earned the Dutchman significant credit among Liverpool's fanbase. There is also sympathy for Slot after a tumultuous summer that saw the exits of key players including Trent Alexander-Arnold and Luis Diaz, an influx of new signings and the death of Portugal attacker Diogo Jota. \"I do not mind giving him the chance to have a go [at fixing this],\" Sexton said. \"I just think, given what he achieved in such a short space of time and how that had this team so far ahead of their timeline, his bosses should keep the faith that he can get back on that road - back to where we belong.\" Liverpool cruised to the league title in Slot's first season in charge, finishing 10 points clear of second-placed Arsenal. \"If they were to sack him, I would be gutted that the man who brought me such brilliant days watching my team lift the league title last season could not work it out, but I would equally understand and try to trust the decision that had been taken,\" Sexton added. \"I would hold reservations about the people sacking him being the same ones involved in the decision-making that led to such an imbalanced squad as it is at present. \"But if I did not trust the process, there would be no point in any of this, really, would there?\" Speaking after the PSV defeat, Slot said his job was not under threat but he did understand why there was growing noise about his position. \"I am feeling safe, I am OK, I have got a lot of support from above,\" he said. \"It would be nice to turn it around and get a victory of course but if you are working as a coach and not doing well then it is normal that questions are asked. \"I am OK with my position. It is not the first time I've been in a difficult position but it is about time that we turned it around.\" Liverpool's next three fixtures offer Slot a promising opportunity to right the ship, starting with a trip to 17th-placed West Ham on Sunday before matches against promoted sides Sunderland and Leeds. Asked about his conversations with the Liverpool hierarchy, Slot added: \"We talk a lot. They are helpful to the team and to me and we have those conversations but they don't call me every single minute of the day to say they trust me. \"In the normal conversations we have I feel the trust. But I haven't spoken to them after this game yet so let's see.\" This video can not be played Liverpool 'lack of intensity' exposed by PSV Former Reds defender Carragher, who made 736 appearances for the club, said he was frustrated with Liverpool's players. \"I have always been in the camp that you stick with the manager... I'm angry with the players, if I'm totally honest,\" Carragher said on CBS Sports. In the past, Liverpool have tended to show patience with their managers rather than sacking them at the first sign of trouble. \"Liverpool's not a sacking club,\" Carragher added. \"Liverpool are different from almost every club in European football - the manager is the king, the manager gets time. \"But it does get to a stage for any manager at a club where it's untenable. It can't go on any longer. \"I'm not quite there yet, but I know others are.\" Sean: Arne Slot won the league with Jurgen Klopp's side. He ripped it apart in the summer and look where we are now. They look clueless. He has to go, I'm afraid. Mark: Getting silly now. I have no idea where this ends. Slot's got to have until Christmas, but if things don't improve soon then I can't see him being in a job in 2026. The players' confidence has just evaporated. Graham: Stunned to be honest. Another early goal and Liverpool seem to just give up. I have never seen a team make so little effort in a match bar a couple of players. If Liverpool aren't careful, we could be headed for relegation this season. Absolutely shocked. Jan: Woeful. Disorganised. No plan. How much more time will be given to a manager who is lacking any idea on what to do? The players should hang their heads in shame - Dominik Szoboszlai and Hugo Ekitike are honourable exceptions. A dreadful game once more. Paul: No fight and players out of position. The buck stops with Slot and his coaching staff. Same mistakes week in week out. Don't like to see managers get sacked but he looks out of his depth. Need to change it now! Chris: A decade of solid development destroyed in 12 games. Motivation has gone and it is not down to the new players as it's almost every aspect of the team. Dominik Szoboszlai is the standout player and he is out of position. What is going on? Where are the leaders? Where is the effort? Where is the soul? We are very much walking alone. Colin: We only looked good playing fast and direct.

    "title": "Hong Kong: Firefighters search for missing in tower blocks fire - BBC News",
    "content": "This video can not be played Watch: Deadly fire engulfs Hong Kong apartment blocks Firefighters are still searching for hundreds of missing people after a massive fire tore through multiple high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. At least 75 people died in the blaze - the city's deadliest in more than 70 years - at Wang Fuk Court's complex, which is home to thousands. The tower blocks had been undergoing extensive renovations - and while the exact cause for the fire is unclear, police say materials on the outside of the buildings may have facilitated its spread. Three construction company executives have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and gross negligence, and Hong Kong's chief executive John Lee has vowed to launch a comprehensive investigation. What we know about the Hong Kong apartment fires The fire, which tore through seven of eight tower blocks in Tai Po district on Wednesday, is now \"basically under control\", Lee said. It started at 14:51 local time (06:51 GMT) on Wednesday, with flames and thick clouds of grey smoke seen billowing from the towers, dominating the city's skyline. By 18:22 local time, officials upgraded the fire to a level five - the most serious category. Firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, was among those killed in the blaze. He was found collapsed at the scene about 30 minutes after contact with him was lost. Eleven other firefighters are also injured, the fire department said. The fierce heat of the blaze, as well as dangerous debris and the risk posed from collapsing scaffolding, has hampered rescue efforts, but the fire department has so far rescued 55 people. \"Despite the complex conditions at the scene, the firefighters' rescue efforts will not stop,\" Lee told a news conference on Thursday evening. More than 270 people remain unaccounted for, while 76 people are injured, Hong Kong's fire service said. As firefighters bring the blaze under control, the extent of the damage is yet to be assessed Thick smoke billowed into the sky as bystanders watched on On Wednesday evening, the fire was classified as a level five - the most severe The fire department said that 767 firefighters were deployed to the scene People have gathered in temporary shelters set up by the government As night fell, the full extent of the fire's ferocity was clear 1 of 6 The mood in Hong Kong has shifted from shock to anguish, as questions grow regarding who should be held accountable for the blaze. Anger has been building on social media, especially after several residents revealed in interviews that they did not hear a fire alarm when the fire broke out. Kiko Ma, 33, who has an apartment in the housing complex, told the BBC that some of the fire alarms had been turned off during the renovation, as construction workers regularly used fire escapes to enter and exit the buildings. Reports of their complaints last year over renovation plans have also resurfaced, and are circulating widely online. Residents had taken issue with high renovation fees and questioned whether the materials used complied with fire-safety regulations. Mesh material and plastic sheets which were found on the outside of the buildings are not believed to be fireproof, while polystyrene was also found on the buildings' windows. These materials may have allowed the fire to spread faster, police said. \"We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,\" a police spokesperson said. Hong Kong's Independent Commission Against Corruption has said it will launch a criminal investigation over the renovation works. Fire safety expert Prof Jiang Liming, from Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said he believed the bamboo scaffolding connecting the apartment blocks may have also helped the fire grow. Bamboo scaffolding is a common sight across Hong Kong - a city known for its high-rise buildings - and is widely used in construction. Lee said he had arranged inspections of \"all housing estates undergoing major repairs\" to check the \"safety of scaffolding and building materials\". He added that the government was considering a review of bamboo scaffolding and whether they should be replaced by metal frameworks. Wang Fuk Court in Hong Kong's northerly suburban Tai Po district was built in 1983 and consists of eight tower blocks providing 1,984 apartments for around 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Nearly 40% of its residents are estimated to be at least 65 years old. Some have lived in the subsidised housing estate since it was built. China's President Xi Jinping has expressed sympathy for the victims and urged that every effort be made to put out the fire and minimise the losses, state media reported. Hong Kong's deadliest fire on record killed 176 people in 1948 and was caused by a ground-floor explosion at a five-storey warehouse.

    "title": "What we know about the Hong Kong apartment fires - BBC News",
    "content": "This video can not be played BBC on the scene of the Hong Kong apartment block blaze A devastating fire has ripped through a high-rise public housing complex in Hong Kong, killing at least 75 people, making it the city's deadliest in more than 60 years. More than 270 people have been reported missing and thousands of residents are in evacuation shelters. Images from the scene show several of the high-rise blocks still ablaze, and thick smoke billowing into the air, dominating the Chinese territory's skyline. Three men have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter connected to the fire, according to local media reports, and an investigation has been launched. Chinese President Xi Jinping has expressed condolences to victims, including a \"firefighter who died in the line of duty\", state media report. What caused the blaze is still unclear, but here is what we do know, so far. Follow live updates: At least 55 dead and hundreds missing in Hong Kong fire The blaze broke out at Wang Fuk Court, a large housing complex in Hong Kong's Tai Po district, at 14:51 local time on Wednesday (06:51 GMT). Wang Fuk Court consists of eight tower blocks, each 31 storeys high. Seven have been affected by the fire, Tai Po district councillor Mui Siu-fung told BBC Chinese. Built in 1983, the tower blocks were undergoing renovations when the fire broke out. Tai Po is a residential district in the northern part of Hong Kong, near the city of Shenzhen on the Chinese mainland. The complex provides 1,984 apartments for some 4,600 residents, according to a 2021 government census. Nearly 40% of the people who lived in the Wang Fuk Court housing complex are at least 65, or older, according to the census. Some of them have lived in the subsidised public housing estate since it was built. The cause of the fire is unknown but a preliminary investigation found that the rapid speed at which it spread was unusual, Hong Kong's security secretary said early on Thursday morning. Police say a mesh material and plastic sheets were found on the outside of the buildings - both of which are not believed to be fireproof. Styrofoam was also found on the building's windows - and that, together with the other construction materials is likely to have caused the flames to spread so quickly, said police. Police have arrested three men aged between 52 and 68 on suspicion of manslaughter in connection with the deadly blaze - two of them are directors of a construction firm while the other is an engineering consultant. A police spokesperson said investigators were looking into the alleged actions, or failure to act, of the firm's top officials. \"We have reason to believe that those in charge at the company were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,\" said the spokesperson. Local media reports also quote some residents who say the fire alarms in the building did not go off. This is Hong Kong's deadliest fire in at least 63 years and has been classified as a level five alarm - the highest in severity. Within 40 minutes of first being reported, it was declared a level four, but by 18:22, about three and a half hours later, the level was raised again. Local media had earlier reported that explosions could be heard inside the building and fire hoses could not easily reach the higher levels. The ferocity of the heat had prevented firefighters from entering the buildings to conduct rescue operations, deputy director of fire services Derek Armstrong Chan told media. As well as 767 firefighters, 128 fire engines, 57 ambulances and some 400 police officers were deployed. Among the dead is firefighter Ho Wai-ho, 37, who was with the service at Sha Tin Fire Station for nine years. The fire service says it lost contact with him at 15:30, and about half an hour later, found that he had collapsed. He was taken to hospital but declared dead shortly after. \"I am profoundly grieved at the loss of this dedicated and gallant fireman,\" said Andy Yeung, director of the fire service. At least one other firefighter is in hospital, the Hong Kong fire service said. Police officers have been helping residents search for family members by using a loudspeaker, say local media reports. This video can not be played Watch: Deadly fire engulfs Hong Kong apartment blocks Several emergency shelters have been set up,externalto accommodate residents who were evacuated, the government said. The South China Morning Post reported that one of them - at Tung Cheong Street Sports Centre - was full, and residents were being directed to other shelters. Another, the Kwong Fuk Community Hall, which is just over the road from the housing estate, was deemed unsafe. Evacuees were moved to another shelter, further away. BBC Chinese reporter Gemini Cheng saw elderly residents, some using walking sticks or wheelchairs, arriving at some of the shelters. At least 900 people are taking shelter in such temporary facilities, Agence France-Presse reports, quoting Lee. Six schools in Tai Po will remain closed on Thursday, the Education Bureau announced,listing the affected schools on its website,external. An emergency monitoring and support centre is in operation to manage the impact of the fire, security secretary Tang Ping-keung said in a statement. A hotline for the public to ask about casualties has been set up by Hong Kong police. The tower blocks at Wang Fuk Court are covered in bamboo scaffolding and green construction netting, right up to the rooftops, because they are undergoing renovations. As mentioned earlier, police have attributed the quick spread of the fire to materials used in the renovation, such as mesh netting, plastic sheeting and styrofoam. It's still unclear what caused the fire, but no matter the cause of the fire, proper netting on the buildings' exterior would have been key to preventing the spread of fire, Jason Poon, chairman of construction NGO China Monitor, told news outlet Initium Media, adding that substandard netting could cause the fire to spread rapidly. Another engineer told Initium Media he believes that the vast majority of mesh netting used in construction across Hong Kong is not made of fire-retardant material. There are also often cardboard, debris and paint thinner found on the scaffolding, which along with dry weather could hasten the spread of fire, the engineer said. One fire safety expert the BBC spoke to earlier said the bamboo scaffolding - a common part of the city's urban landscape - also played a part in fanning the flames. Local media reports in March said the government's development bureau had been trying to phase out the use of bamboo because of safety concerns. The push towards using metal instead of bamboo came after a spate of scaffolding-related deaths in Hong Kong. Professor Jiang Liming from Hong Kong Polytechnic University also noted that the blocks at Wang Fuk Court were \"relatively old\" - they were built in the 1980s - so \"the glass windows are not that fire resilient\". \"The modern buildings have double pane glass windows, but for this one they perhaps used just a single pane... [which makes it] very easy to be broken by the flames and the flames can then penetrate through the facade.\" Additional reporting by Jack Lau, BBC Global China Unit and Gemini Cheng, BBC Chinese in Hong Kong.

Above all I am interested in the experiences of human beings as they navigate the interlocking crises of our time. I spent a decade as an international correspondent for The Times in West Africa, South Asia and South Africa. I have also worked as a media executive, serving as editor in chief of HuffPost and managing director of Gimlet, a podcast studio at Spotify. Before joining The Times, I was a staff writer for The Orlando Sentinel and The Times Union in Albany, N.Y. My mother is Ethiopian, and my father was American, and I spent most of my childhood and a good chunk of my professional life in Africa. These experiences inform my perspective and work, which aims to look at global events and the United States from perspectives other than those of the rich, Western world. I attended Saint John’s College, earning a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and mathematics, as well as Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. I am proud to have won a number of awards for my reporting over the years, including the Polk and the Livingston Awards for international reporting. I live in New York City with my wife and two dogs. Human dignity is at the core of my work. I often write about vulnerable and marginalized people, and I try to take special care to ensure my reporting and writing do not cause them harm. I always strive to tell stories with nuance and respect. I am an opinion columnist and write about my views and convictions, but I am deeply committed to independence, rigorous reporting and accuracy. My work is informed by my life experiences and, whenever possible, the experiences of people I have met and spoken to in depth, as well as things I have been able to witness.

    "title": "‘Oh my God, this is our Tanzania’: CNN investigation shows police shooting protesters, signs of mass graves | CNN",
    "content": "EDITOR’S NOTE:This story contains disturbing images. In the chaotic aftermath of Tanzania’s disputed presidential election last month, police and gun-wielding men on patrol shot at groups of protesters, many of whom appeared unarmed or were holding only rocks and sticks, a CNN investigation has found. Geolocated videos from the scenes, audio forensic analysis of the shots fired and first-hand accounts from witnesses and victims document the brutality unleashed on young demonstrators following the re-election of President Samia Suluhu Hassan – who claimed she won with 98% of the vote on October 29 after barring her chief rivals from the presidential race. Videos verified by CNN also support witness reports about the deadly toll of the post-election crackdown, showing morgues overflowing with scores of bodies. Additionally, satellite images and videos show recently disturbed soil consistent with reports of mass graves in the Kondo cemetery, north of the East African country’s main city of Dar es Salaam. Two human rights groups and witnesses interviewed by CNN say the bodies of protesters killed in the past few weeks have been buried there. After the election, authorities imposed a curfew and an internet blackout as people gathered in the streets to contest the exclusion of Hassan’s rivals from the polls. The main opposition party leader, Tundu Lissu, has been in custody since April, charged with treason. When internet connectivity was partially restored a week later, police barred the sharing of photos and videos “that cause panic.” Government officials initially denied any killings of protesters had occurred. Last week, however, the president acknowledged there had been some casualties, but she did not release any figures. Hassan on Thursday launched a commission to investigate the unrest, but also suggested that protesters were paid. In a press conference Sunday, Tanzania’s government spokesperson Gerson Msigwa called the investigation a “biased report” intended to “mislead and incite” accusing CNN of not giving Tanzanian authorities opportunity to respond. CNN sent detailed questions to Msigwa, the police and the country’s ministry of health, but did not receive a response. “If they want to find us, we’re available. We’ll answer their questions. We’re not blocking them from doing their job. But they should do it professionally and fairly,” Msigwa said. The commission of inquiry is in process, he added. In a statement posted on X Tuesday, the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee demanded an independent investigation of the “tragic acts” in Tanzania, citing CNN’s reporting. “This report underscores the disturbing actions by the Tanzanian Government to suppress protestors,” the committeesaid, linking to the CNN story. “Evidence of mass graves show an unacceptable attempt to cover-up gross violations of human rights.” The crackdown on protesters has marred the reputation of Tanzania as a stable democracy that attracts millions of tourists every year. The United Nations Human Rights Office, based on information from multiple sources in the country, suggested hundreds of protesters and other civilians were killed, with an unknown number injured or detained. With the help ofopen-source investigator Benjamin Strick,CNN reviewed dozens of videos and images of civilians lying dead from gunshot wounds, as well as images of bodies overflowing morgues at the Sekou-Toure Regional Referral Hospital in Mwanza and the Mwananyamala Hospital in Dar es Salaam. In Mwanza, photos and videos geolocated by CNN outside the hospital show at least 10 bodies piled up on a stretcher. One doctor, who treated victims of gunshot wounds over the course of four days there and requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, said the dead were brought to the morgue by police “until it was full.” After that, he said, they “piled” the bodies outside the hospital. Many victims, both dead and injured, were young men, the doctor said. “All had sustained gunshot wounds on different parts of the body. Especially the head, abdomen, chest, lower limbs. Badly wounded patients with varying degrees of consciousness,” he told CNN. In Dar es Salaam, a video geolocated by CNN at the morgue of Mwananyamala Hospital shows dozens of bodies covering the floor, piled up on top of each other. Tanzania’s Ministry of Health denied the authenticity of the footage in a statement on social media. The ministry did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. A woman, who requested anonymity out of concern for her safety, told CNN she saw the video from the morgue and recognized the body of her brother, who was killed during the protests on the balcony of his own home. “We’ve been looking for his body at every mortuary in Dar es Salaam since 1st November, but he was not there,” she told CNN. According to witnesses, demonstrations broke out shortly after polls opened on October 29 and continued for a few days after in some locations. In one violent encounter analyzed by CNN, Tanzanian police in the city of Arusha fatally shot two protesters who appeared to be no threat to them – a pregnant woman who was shot in the back while running away, and a young man who was shot in the head. At 3:27 p.m. the day of the election, a group of young men who were gathered at an intersection, were confronted by about 10 armed police officers. One protester appears to be seen throwing a rock at them. Two minutes later, the scene becomes frantic, according to a video circulating on social media which Strick first geolocated. CNN obtained the original footage and confirmed his findings by analyzing its metadata. In the video, demonstrators are seen running down the road amid bursts of gunfire. One woman wearing a lavender top and a hat, holding a stick and a rock, is fatally shot in the back as she’s running with other protesters. She drops to the ground, blood coming out of her blouse. Other demonstrators attempt unsuccessfully to help the woman to her feet and administer aid. In another video, a woman can be heard asking the mortally injured woman  to wake up. The protesters, in distress, can be heard calling for help. A forensic analysis of the scene shows that the woman was shot from behind: a hole in the blouse, the entry point of the bullet, can be seen shortly after a gunshot is heard. Moments later, the woman drops the stick and stone, and collapses. Sources close to her family confirmed to CNN that the woman was three months pregnant, leaving behind a husband and two children. Rob Maher, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University who specializes in forensic audio analysis, examined audio extracted from the original video of the shooting. Based on the time gap between the “crack” sound, the ballistic shockwave of the bullet and the “boom” of the muzzle blast, Maher established the distance between the firearm and microphone of the device that filmed the video to be about 112 meters (367 feet). A few minutes later, a video filmed from the other side of the road shows a protester dressed in black walking towards the police position at the top of the road. Another protester throws a rock, a shot rings out and a different man with a red shirt is seen collapsing, with a visible head injury. The video was first geolocated by Strick, the open-source investigator, and verified by CNN. Another video of the encounter shows the man lying in a pool of blood, still breathing. “Oh my God, this is our Tanzania,” repeats the person filming, along with a Muslim prayer. The man was visible in earlier footage, holding a rock, but he didn’t appear to have anything in his hands when he was shot and killed. The victim was at least 95 meters away from police at the time he was shot, according to an audio analysis by Maher. Both this distance and the one calculated in the video of the shooting of the pregnant woman correspond to the visible location of police at the top of the road, according to CNN’s analysis. An eyewitness to both shootings told CNN the Arusha protest had started peacefully until police started firing at them. The witness saw the pregnant woman being shot in front of her. “I tried to call for help from others to pull her (the pregnant woman) aside because she was still breathing but shots kept getting fired and it hit one young man on the head. It was the most inhumane thing ever,” the witness said. “Someone’s mother died while I and others watched.” In other parts of the country, videos have surfaced on social media of security officers and of armed men in plain clothes – who locals suspect are police – pursuing protesters and opening fire on them. CNN has geolocated several videos showing what appear to be plainclothes officers getting off white pick-up trucks in Dar es Salaam and opening fire in the backstreets of civilian areas. A series of drone videos filmed in the Segerea area of the city, along Tabata Road, shows protesters fleeing and taking shelter in courtyards of a side street, as a white pick-up truck approaches. Armed individuals are then seen getting off the truck and opening fire repeatedly as they roam around a civilian area. The armed men were filmed operating alongside uniformed police officers in the Ubungo area of Dar es Salaam. Viral Scout Management, a local sports management consultancy, released astatement on Xsaying that seven young soccer players under their contracts were shot and killed at their homes during the protests. The management firm laterposted on Xthat the bodies of six of them could not be located. The woman who recognized her brother in the Mwananyamala morgue footage told CNN the family had not located the body of another of her brothers reportedly shot dead at home in the Mara region. Allegations of mass graves have emerged in the past few weeks, with Chadema, the main opposition political party, accusing police of disposing of hundreds of unknown bodies at undisclosed locations. A coalition of Tanzanian human rights groups and two local sources told CNN that some of the bodies of the protesters killed after October 29 in Dar es Salaam were buried in a mass grave at the Kondo cemetery in Kunduchi, north of the city. High-resolution satellite imagery from Planet Labs and Vantor taken on November 9 and November 15 shows disturbed ground in a barren plot of land 60 meters from the edge of existing graves. Further analysis of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery shows that the digging was done there between November 2 and November 5. A video filmed on the ground after the soil was disturbed, and obtained by CNN, shows a series of spots of sandy, overturned soil, that weave between patches of vegetation. The exact reason for the disturbance is unclear. In one area of the fresh soil, what appear to be roots stick out, and atop another is what appears to be a couple of articles of fabric.

    "title": "Venezuelan military preparation: How Maduro’s forces are responding to US deployments in the Caribbean | CNN",
    "content": "The Venezuelan military has been actively promoting on social media its nationwide preparations to defend against a possible US offensive, as tensions with the Trump administration continue to escalate. Experts say the new and exaggerated show of force, which included low-altitude fighter jet passes over major cities and live-fire drills off the coast, is meant to attract fresh attention to its military capabilities. CNN analyzed Venezuelan military footage, verified social media video, and other open-source data since early September to explore how President Nicolás Maduro’s regime is flexing its comparatively modest military muscle in its standoff with the US. Venezuela’s preparations have been met with demonstrations of US air and naval power in the Caribbean, including an“attack demo” on Thursdaythat featured a reconnaissance aircraft, attack plane and bomber, among other airframes. “The US is obviously the dominant force. No surprises there,” Ryan Berg, director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told CNN. “But we shouldn’t be cavalier.” He stressed that nobody should be underestimating Venezuela’s capabilities. Outmatched in the Caribbean, Berg believes, this could become an existential fight for Maduro’s regime — and it’s clear that Venezuela is preparing for every possibility. Caracas is actively being fortified with fresh layers of defenses, with one of the most striking developments on the outskirts of the capital, near Venezuela’s coastline in the north. Along the Caracas-La Guaira highway, a critical route that connects the Caribbean shoreline to Caracas, an array of concrete anti-vehicle “hedgehog” barriers has been expanded. Venezuelan authorities posted footage on October 9 from the highway, which was verified by CNN, showing dozens of concrete “hedgehog” obstacles alongside heavy machinery emblazoned with the military’s logo. While the exact date they were installed remains unclear, recent satellite imagery shows these strategically placed obstacles near a key choke point, where armored vehicles would be forced to slow. Their location is not incidental; the narrow corridor is the only practical land route for any invading force to reach the capital, experts say. In an address televised on the state-run network VTV on Wednesday, Maduro revealed a “comprehensive defense plan” for Caracas and La Guaira, outlining where weapons and systems could be deployed along the corridor, “street by street, community by community…” With the arrival of advanced US warplanes and drones to the Caribbean, Maduro’s armed forces are putting their air defense capabilities on full display. Last week, footage published by a Venezuelan military unit showed a mobile Russian air defense system, the P-18-2M early warning radar used to detect incoming aircraft or munitions, deployed at a military base east of Caracas, on Isla Margarita. Other systems were shown off during air defense drills at a military compound in the capital, including a medium-range Buk-M2E. The Venezuelan National Bolivarian Armed Forces (FANB) has nearly a dozen others, all Russian-built, according toCSIS figures. Anti-air platforms like these are critical to protecting Venezuelan airspace, but experts have questioned the condition of some. Seemingly in an attempt to dissuade concerns, one FANB unit publishedfootageof soldiers scrubbing a shorter-range Pechora S-125 anti-air system with soap and water. Butquestions remainabout the combat readiness of other platforms, like the long-range S-300 surface-to-air missile systems bought by Venezuela years ago that have been notably scarce in government media and drills in recent weeks. These developments come just weeks after a mysterious plane —sanctionedfor shipping cargoto Russian allies blacklisted by the US — landed in the capital. While it remains unclear what was delivered, Russian Duma member Alexei Zhuravlev claims it transported new Pantsir-S1 and Buk-M2E air defense systems to Caracas, in aninterviewwith Gazeta.ru. The delivery may have also included modern missiles that would notably strengthen Venezuela’s air defense network, retired U.S. Marine Corps Col. Mark Cancian told CNN. CNN has reached out to the Venezuelan Defense Ministry about the flight. At the Venezuelan Military Academy in southern Caracas, members of the armed forces practice small drone attacks with the help of a popular video game, seen in footage published by the Venezuelan Army. “The second commander destroyed it…” one of the soldiers says, crowding the cadet holding a controller. “We’re here waiting to advance, come closer!” With the makeshift simulator, Venezuelan soldiers train amid a wider effort to ratchet up force readiness across the country. On another simulated battlefield, footage shared by a FANB commander shows Venezuelan troops running live-fire training drills near an uninhabited island less than 25 miles from where US warships recently docked in Trinidad and Tobago. Nationwide enlistment drives began in August, when Madurocalled for volunteersto join the Bolivarian militia to strengthen the country’s defenses. The militia, a reserve force composed of civilians, is a branch in the Venezuelan Armed Forces. While the conventional military has approximately 123,000 members, Maduro has claimed the volunteer militia has grown to 8 million, though expertshave called into questionthat number as well as the quality of the troops’ training. Far from munitions testing grounds and training facilities, civilians in Venezuela are watching the Maduro regime showcase its air power. In downtown Maracay, one of Venezuela’s largest cities, pedestrians looked up to see F-16 fighter jets roaring over museums and shopping centers; and on the luxurious Isla Margarita, Russian-made Su-30 warplanes passed overhead. The seven warplanes seen here account for about 20% of Venezuela’s combat aircraft, according to data published by CSIS. Without access to spare parts and regular maintenance, Berg explained, they’re “utilizing precious flight hours… to demonstrate [Venezuelan air power].” The country’s air force is small, with most airworthy attack planes being Russian-made Su-30 jets, among a few F-16 and F-5 fighters bought from the US decades ago, which could face aformidable US presencein the Caribbean.

    "title": "Ralph Leroy Menzies: Utah death row inmate with dementia dies 3 months after court blocked his execution | CNN",
    "content": "A Utah man who was spared execution this fall after developing dementia during his37 years on death rowdied Wednesday of apparent natural causes, according to the state’s Department of Corrections. Ralph Leroy Menzies, 67, wasset to die by firing squadin September, but the Utah Supreme Courtblocked the impending executionin August after his attorneys argued his dementia had become too severe. A judge had scheduled a new competency hearing for mid-December to reevaluate his mental state. Menzies was convicted of abducting and killing 26-year-old mother of three Maurine Hunsaker near Salt Lake City in 1986. Her body was discovered two days later. Her husband, Jim Hunsaker, told The Associated Press he felt a “happy feeling” when he heard Menzies had died, and as though 100 pounds had been lifted off him. Mass murderer George Banks, spared from death penalty, dies in prison 43 years after rampage “I think a lot of it is going to be just healing now,” he said. “I don’t think there was a day that I didn’t think about it.” He expressed frustration about how the state’s judicial system handled the case, saying his family for decades has experienced “one disappointment after another.” “It seems like everything went his way,” he said. Menzies would have been the seventh US prisoner executed by firing squad since 1977, when the US reinstated the death penalty. He selected the method when given a choice decades ago. The Utah Supreme Court said this summer that the progression of Menzies’ disease raised a significant question on his fitness to be executed. A state medical professional agreed in a new mental competency report published this month, saying Menzies lacked a rational understanding of why he was facing execution. He’s one of numerous US prisoners who have died naturally while on death row. More than half of all prisoners sentenced to death in the US spend more than 18 years awaiting execution, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Utah Attorney General Derek Brown said he hopes Hunsaker’s family will finally have some closure and peace. Menzies abducted Hunsaker from a convenience store where she worked on February 23, 1986, while he was on parole. She later called her husband to say she was robbed and kidnapped, and that her abductor intended to release her. Days later, a hiker found her body at a picnic area about 16 miles away in Big Cottonwood Canyon. She had been strangled and her throat was slashed. Utah Supreme Court blocks execution of prisoner with dementia who chose to die by firing squad “For decades, the state of Utah has pursued justice on her behalf. The path has been long and filled with pain, far more than any victim’s family should ever have to endure,” Brown said. Police say Hunsaker’s thumbprint was found in a car that Menzies was driving, and her purse was recovered in Menzies’ apartment. Menzies also had her wallet and other belongings when he was jailed on unrelated matters. “We’re grateful that Ralph passed naturally and maintained his spiritedness and dignity until the end,” his legal team said in a statement.

    "title": "Hair transplants for women are booming. Their success rate is complicated | CNN",
    "content": "It started slowly, with handfuls of hair circling the plug hole in the shower. Then eventually British bodybuilder Tracy Kiss began to notice she could see her scalp when her hair was wet. “I always had really thick hair,” Kiss said from her home in north London. “It was kind of inconvenient that there was so much of it.” But shortly after the birth of her two children at 25, Kiss — who is now 38 — couldn’t believe that her “massive head of hair had become a whisper.” In the mornings, choosing a hairstyle became less about self-expression and more about disguise. Kiss often tied her hair up flat to her head to hide the thinning at her temples, or cycled through extensions, wigs and hats. “In photos I would just look and think, ‘Oh my god. It’s getting worse by the day,’” she said. Her blood test results showed she was deficient in vitamins like iron. She exhausted hair supplements, specialist shampoos and even PRP injections (a dermatological procedure where her own plasma was injected back into her hair follicles in an attempt to stimulate growth). “It makes you feel so demoralized,” said Kiss. “You feel as a woman, your hair is your crowning glory. So to take that away, you almost lose your identity.” According to Harvard health experts, at least one third of women experience some form of hair loss during their life. While there are a myriad of causes, female pattern hair loss — which can stem from a complex combination of hormone imbalances and family history, also known as androgenetic alopecia — is the most common, with one study suggesting it affects around 40% of women in the US by the age of 50. CNN spoke to three women who decided to treat their hair loss through surgery. Hair transplants are the only cosmetic procedure where male patients significantly outnumber females, but the number of women opting in rose by more than 16% between 2021 and 2024, according to the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (ISHRS). Kiss first came across the procedure in 2011 after researching treatment options for her boyfriend at the time who also struggled with hair loss. Interested in what a transplant could do for her, she enquired — but said she was rejected on the basis of her gender. “I consulted with surgeons, and they said hair transplants are only for men,” she remembered. “It wasn’t available at all.” It took her 11 years of research, around $3,400 and one willing doctor to finally let her go under the knife. “Initially they said no,” she said. “I just pushed hard enough that they said yes.” In 2022, she flew to Turkey to have 2,500 follicles implanted across her hairline and temples using a common technique called Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE), whereby clusters of hair follicles are removed directly from a designated donor area, usually on the head. Kiss said she had a quick recovery, going out for dinner immediately after surgery and weaning herself off pain medication just 24 hours later. According to plastic surgeon and hair transplant specialist Dr. Greg Williams, the surgery comes in many shapes and sizes. The women he sees include those experiencing traction alopecia, a condition sometimes caused by repeatedly tight hairstyles that damage the follicles and trans women looking to lower and “feminize” their hairline. The leading cause of hair loss for cisgender women in both the US and the UK is genetics. Yet Williams says this camp is “often not an optimal patient group for transplant.” The condition, he explains, can worsen over time if not stabilized. “When I speak to women with female genetic hair loss about having a hair transplant, it’s about buying time rather than being a long-lasting solution,” he said. Hormones, pregnancy, post-lactation complications, stress, illness and nutrition, multiple factors “affect female hair much more” than male, Williams argues. “We don’t understand female hair loss,” he said. Still, more women than ever are seeking out the procedure. Thirty-two-year-old Ayca Bozok from Germany traveled to Turkey, where her mother was born, to receive an FUE hair transplant across her hairline and parting. She remembers her hair started to thin around 15 years old, when she was still in secondary school. “It made some days worse for me in the morning to style my hair,” she said in a video call. “I was using a lot of bandana scarves to cover it up.” For Bozok, losing her hair when she was forging an identity was the most difficult. “You’re just developing as a female,” she said. “You just have your looks. You don’t even have an academic status, you don’t have a job, money, anything else.” She was diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia as a teenager, but a traumatic life event caused Bozok’s hair loss to accelerate in her early 20s. “I lost my hair within a week,” she said. “That was a really hard experience for me, because before it was gradually getting thinner.” In a state of emergency, Bozok took out a student loan to pay for multiple rounds of PRP injections and nutrition plans. She believes that these treatments, along with reducing overall stress, meant she was able to recover about 60% of her hair after a few years, but feeling trapped by the restrictive daily routine of hair fibers (a powder used to create the appearance of thicker hair) and other camouflaging methods, she still decided to pursue a transplant in 2024. “One day, I was annoyed. I didn’t want to use the fibers anymore,” she said. Bozok recounts her approach as “super impulsive.” She didn’t do much research to find her surgeon, compare prices or investigate what type of transplant technique she would be receiving. Before she knew it, she was WhatsApp messaging her surgeon photos of her hairline. While Bozok said she did not specifically share her androgenetic alopecia diagnosis with her surgeon, she did tell them that genetic hair loss ran in her family. She said the clinic agreed on implanting 3,500 follicles for around $2,900, although because of her thin hair density technicians couldn’t extract more than 2,800 follicles on the day of her operation. She described a “moderate, bearable pain” for eight days after surgery. One year on, Bozok is happy with her results and has been documenting the healing process on Instagram and TikTok — where some of her videos have reached thousands of views. But she tries to be realistic about her expectations and understands that because of her diagnosis, the transplant may not last forever. “People in my comment section have told me that they’ve lost their transplanted hair after two years, five years, 10 years,” she said. “My state of mind is I enjoy it as long as I have it.” Facelifts aren’t just to combat aging. Young people are using it to finesse facial features For many women experiencing genetic hair loss, finding a solution can be like chasing a moving target. Awareness of hair transplant surgery has skyrocketed in the last decade, with ISHRS reporting that procedures in Europe alone increased 240% between 2010 and 2021. But Williams is concerned that new transplant clinics set up to meet rising demand are exploiting the desperation that comes with female pattern hair loss. “Patients with hair loss, both men and women, are psychologically very vulnerable and ripe to be taken advantage of,” he said. “It’s heartbreaking.” Sam Evans, a 40-year old from Northampton, England, believes she was poorly assessed for the hair transplant she received in 2024. Evans began to notice thinning and bald spots a decade ago, but for a long time ignored her hair loss due to the shame she felt. “I probably cried most days getting ready,” she said in a video interview. In 2019, Evans saw a specialist in hair and scalp health — also known as a trichologist — who advised that she might be dealing with female pattern hair loss. After an unsuccessful round of PRP injections in 2022, she said the nurse recommended Evans to a hair transplant clinic in London. “I look back now and obviously wish I had done my research,” she said. “I just went with the initial recommendation.” The surgeon Evans saw knew she had androgenetic alopecia and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) — two conditions that can cause unpredictable hair loss. She paid approximately $8,500 for her transplant, which took over 10 “excruciating” hours to complete. Evans also says the anaesthetic did not fully numb her pain. “I was just sobbing the whole time,” she said, tearing up at the memory. “It was a really, really tough day.” In the two weeks immediately after her operation, Evans felt too self-conscious of her healing wounds to leave the house. “It’s just a constant reminder every time you look in the mirror,” she said. “It’s just not pleasant.” She found the recovery stressful because of the “many rules” she had to abide by to give her grafts the best chance of success — and struggled to sleep as a result. Evans’ doctor told her she would likely need to receive two or three transplants because of her thin hair. “It was clear my hair isn’t very dense,” she said. But she trusted the procedure would only go ahead if her surgeon thought “the grafts would be of good quality.” Now, Evans believes she has overall thinning due to her genetic hair loss condition — meaning there was no area of her scalp healthy enough to harvest hair from to implant in the first place. As her body recovered from the shock of the surgery, Evans started to lose even more hair. “If anything, my hair is worse than it was beforehand,” she said. Evans said her surgeon, though clear on the fact there is always a risk of failure, assured her that her hairline would be reinforced by the transplant. Specifically, she came away believing that she would be able to wear it up in a ponytail. “I cannot do that,” she said. Now, she relies on wigs every day and has even launched her own wig brand. “It sounds dramatic to say, but wigs have changed my life.” Williams believes some women are being approved for the surgery without receiving a proper diagnosis of the root cause of their hair loss or being operated on despite not being good candidates. He thinks that for some unscrupulous surgeons, it can be hard to say no to a patient. “You may cut corners and operate on people who you know would be better off delayed until they go on medication to stabilize their hair loss,” he said. He campaigns for better regulation and public awareness surrounding transplants, which he thinks sit in a “gray area” between “surgical and non-surgical,” meaning no accreditation or training is necessary to carry them out. “Hair transplant surgery is interesting because it’s a crossroads between healthcare and running a business,” Williams said. “In the majority of cases, it’s being done in private clinics, behind closed doors,” he said. “Nobody knows what’s going on in there. Nobody’s inspecting.” For Kiss, the procedure enabled her to step back in time. “You never know what you’ve got until it’s gone,” she said. “And the feeling of getting it back is the most euphoric second chance.” But not every woman experiencing hair loss is as lucky. Bozok says her transplant success turned bittersweet after she found out her progress videos were being used to sell unevidenced hair loss treatments on social media without her consent. “I was shocked,” she said. “When I was dealing with hair loss, I was buying lots of things because you’re so desperate.” Bozok confronted what she called “scammy” businesses, requesting that they remove her images and videos from their feed. Some complied, while others simply blocked her. “The sad part is people will buy the products because they buy the hope,” she said. Williams recommends that those looking for hair loss treatment first receive a diagnosis from a specialist and never pay for a transplant without directly speaking to the surgeon who will be performing it. “In the first consultation before you’re booking in, ask who is going to be making the incisions in my skin,” he said. Physicians should also be associated with the ISHRS, which provides educational training, clinical practice guidelines and a code of conduct that members must abide by. For Bozok, Kiss and Evans, sharing their transplant experience online has given them each a community and a support system — regardless of whether their surgery worked or not. Thousands of people have tuned into Kiss’ YouTube videos documenting her healing process, and Bozok’s Instagram DMs are flooded with requests for advice and reassurance from other female patients. Even men reach out to her, asking how they could be more supportive to the women in their life experiencing hair loss. For Evans, the online network has been nothing short of “empowering.” “That’s where I realized that androgenetic alopecia for women is really, really, really common,” she said. “We all connect with each other, we share our stories, we support each other.” © 2025 Cable News Network.

    "title": "Tourist dies after being bitten by shark in Australia | CNN",
    "content": "A tourist believed to be in her 20s has died after being bitten by a shark in Australia on Thursday, according to police. A man, also believed to be in his 20s, suffered serious injuries in the attack at Crowdy Bay, easternAustralia, and was airlifted to hospital in a critical condition, said New South Wales police in a statement. Emergency services were called around 6:30 a.m. local time (2:30 p.m. Wednesday ET) following reports that two people had been bitten by a shark, said police. “Witnesses assisted the pair prior to the arrival of NSW Ambulance paramedics; however, the woman died at the scene,” reads the statement. Crowdy Bay is about 350 kilometers (217 miles) north of Sydney. Authorities have not yet determined what species of shark was involved in the attack. The victims are tourists from Switzerland, a police spokesperson told CNN on Thursday. Ambulance superintendent Joshua Smyth told journalists that the woman had died by the time paramedics arrived on the scene. He also praised a bystander who administered first aid to the male victim, including putting a tourniquet around his leg. Rare deadly shark attack sparks ocean hunt in Sydney, Australia Smyth said the tourniquet “potentially saved his life and allowed New South Wales Ambulance paramedics to get to him and render first aid.” Local rescue organization Surf Life Saving NSW saidthat nearby beaches would be closed for at least 24 hours while they try and find the shark using drones. “This is a terrible tragedy and our deepest condolences go to the families of the woman and man involved,” said Surf Life Saving NSW CEO Steve Pearce, CNN affiliate7Newsreports. “We have been able to activate our drone capability quickly and have assets on scene to provide surveillance and report on any remaining dangers in the area,” he added. “For now, please remain clear of the water at beaches in the vicinity and follow the direction of lifeguards.” © 2025 Cable News Network.

    "title": "How Emma Mazzenga is redefining athletic longevity at 92 years old | CNN",
    "content": "Emma Mazzengais no ordinary 92-year-old. The Italian is an elite sprinter who has broken multiple world records in track and field. Mazzenga, who was born in 1933, made global headlines in 2024 when she broke the 200-meter world indoor record in the over-90s age group, finishing the race in a time of 54.47 seconds. She still continues to race, both attempting to break records and enjoying the thrill of running. “I just like the competition. And even now, maybe a little less than in the past, I still feel tense before each race,” she toldCNN Sports, adding that she set a new 200m personal best of 50.34 seconds back in June. Many people have wanted to know the secrets of her success and how someone her age has managed to stay fit and continue training at such a high level. Mazzenga said there isn’t a day that goes by when she doesn’t do some sort of physical activity – but this wasn’t something she did throughout her entire life, despite an early passion for sports. “I have always loved playing sports. When I was in high school, when I was 14 or 15 years old, I played basketball. Then I went to university, and the president organized a team of female athletes, so I competed for the University of Padua for seven or eight years,” Mazzenga said. “I was very good but I was certainly more suited for an individual sport, so I continued. I graduated while continuing to compete. But then, in 1963, I got married, and for 25 years, I had school and family, so I didn’t do anything. “I went to the mountains, hiked, went skiing, but I gave up competitive sports and resumed in 1986 at age 53. “Since 1986, I resumed training; then I also had a coach and I always trained three times a week – initially a couple of hours, now one hour a day.” Emma is testament that it’s never too late to start again. Her apartment, where she lives alone on the outskirts of the historic city of Padova, is full of hundreds of medals and trophies that she has collected competing all over the world for the last 40 or so years. One of her favorites is on her wall – a medal from theWorld Masters Athletics Championshipsin the W75 400-meter race from the United States: “It was the first one, the first world title in Sacramento in 2011.” To achieve such success, Mazzenga follows a balanced diet without any specific strict restriction, enjoying small portions and a nightly glass of red wine. “At five in the morning, I’m awake. I have breakfast and generally have a ham sandwich or salami sandwich and then do various things,” she says. “I go outside, go for a walk, go shopping, do some cleaning around the house. Then I’ll generally have a snack, then some fruit and a couple of cookies. “At 12, lunch of course, and I eat some pasta – 30 or 40 grams – and meat or fish and vegetables. In the afternoon, I read. I go to the movies because I have a multiplex here 200 meters away, so it is very convenient. Or maybe I’ll take the tram downtown. “In the evening, I’ll eat some vegetables, and afterwards I’ll sit in front of the television and, more often than not, I’ll fall asleep.” After reading about the nonagenarian’s record-breaking races, Simone Porcelli, an Italian professor of human physiology at the University of Pavia (located almost 19 miles south of Milan), contacted Mazzenga to be part of a study called the TRAJECTORAGE Project. The Italian-based research project – headquartered at the University of Pavia with researchers from the Politecnico di Milano, University of Padova and Politecnico di Torino in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin and Universidad de Castilla-La Mancha in Toledo, Spain – aims to investigate the physiological mechanisms underlying the deterioration of neuromuscular function with age through long-term monitoring (every six to 12 months) of healthy people over 60. The goal is to improve the knowledge of the relationship between the nervous system and skeletal muscle, while also understanding the protective role of physical exercise. “As we age, we get slower, we were not as fast as we used to be. We don’t jump as high, for example, we don’t move enough and sometimes we are not (moving) that (much) physically, right? So that, you know, brings us to decline a little bit as we age,” Martino Franchi, one of the researchers based at the University of Padova, told CNN Sports. “So what we want to understand with this study is: is there a point in our life where things start to go downhill?” The researchers involved in the two-year study say Mazzenga is their “cherry on the cake” because she is the oldest and most active participant in the project, helping them understand why some people age faster than others. The multi-world record holder was previously tested 18 months ago, and they found her cardiorespiratory fitness to be similar to that of someone in their 50s, and her muscle’s mitochondrial function to be as good as that of a healthy 20-year-old. This month, Mazzenga was back in the hot seat at the University of Pavia labs, as CNN Sports went along to witness her undergoing tests over the course of a day. The scientists leading the project were keen to see if she had physiologically aged since the last round of tests. A piece of Mazzenga’s muscle was collected from her quadriceps to check fiber size, capillarization, mitochondrial function, and single-fiber mechanics to determine the strength and speed of contraction. She also underwent a maximal cycling test, an ultrasound scan, and neuromuscular evaluations to determine her cardiovascular fitness, leg strength, and oxygen delivery efficiency. Franchi said they were eager to see how Emma had changed since her last test 18 months ago. Her deep muscle architecture resembled that of a much younger person, similar to athletes tested for performance. “I’ve never met someone like Emma,” Franchi noted, calling her a unique and “top-notch example.” After the results came in, one thing was clear: Mazzenga had aged, as expected, but nowhere near as much as an average person. This anomaly is exactly what researchers wanted to understand – why her decline is so minimal compared to typical aging patterns and what mechanisms inside the muscle might explain this resilience. “(Mazzenga) will give us a reference point that we will use as a comparison to look back, maybe on the general population and understanding, if the same traits that we see on Emma can be found on some people. And if those are related to either, you know, like somebody that found the Fountain of Youth and we don’t know where it is yet or if this is related to exercise and physical activity.” Still, for Mazzenga, she continues working out or training three days a week, but she says the secret lies in something more basic. “I go for a walk here in the neighborhood, or I go downtown. In short, I move. I never stay a whole day in the house unless it is weather that prevents me going out. “This is important. This is how it should be continued. And above all – do not isolate yourself. (It’s been) a year plus (that) I started to attend some groups here in the neighborhood and also this morning I was there and we meet with different topics, we read some books in short so that we can find each other. “It is very, very, very important.” © 2025 Cable News Network.

    "title": "Russia to tighten immigration rules – Security Council — RT Russia & Former Soviet Union",
    "content": "Russia no longer sees immigration as a way to offset falling birthrates and will not allow migrants to overstay their legal welcome, Aleksandr Grebenkin, deputy secretary of the country’s Security Council, has said. In an interview with Rossiyskaya Gazeta released Tuesday, the senior official commented on Russia’s State Migration Policy for 2026-2030, approved in October. He said it prioritizes national security and economic development while focusing on combating illegal immigration and integrating foreigners who share traditional values. “According to the new policy, the migration of foreign citizens to our country is no longer viewed as an auxiliary means of addressing demographic issues, but rather as an additional tool for implementing economic measures,”he stated. He explained that foreigners cannot expect permanent residence in Russia, except for certain categories, and must leave when their legal stay expires. “The migration situation has changed significantly,”he added.“New security threats have emerged as hostile states and radical groups seek to exploit migration to undermine our interests, destabilize domestic politics, and fuel tensions with migrants’ home countries.” He said migrants’ worldview has also shifted, shaped by different environments. He pointed to arrivals from former Soviet republics who he said often show“a dismissive and consumerist attitude toward Russia.” “All of this fuels rising tensions in Russian society over migration and the emergence of interethnic and interfaith conflicts,”he stated. Grebenkin said Russia has introducedmeasuresto remove newcomers who may pose risks, including mandatory fingerprinting, health checks, photographing, and digitized migration records. He said these and otherstepshave helped cut the number of foreign citizens staying in Russia illegally more than threefold. Russian officials have long warned of a looming demographic crisis, with 2024 data showing the lowest annual birthrates since 1999. The government has rolled out multiple support measures, including lump-sum childbirth payments and expanded maternity benefits. Russia has tightened migration rules following the deadly Crocus City Hall terrorist attack last year, in which Islamic State-linked Tajik nationals killed 149 people at the behest of Ukrainian intelligence, according to Russian authorities. At a government meeting last month, President Vladimir PutinsaidRussia will not follow countries that try to address demographic issues by replacing native populations with“chaotic migration.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.

    "title": "Zelensky aide looked ‘gutted’ after Trump rejected Kiev’s spin on peace plan – NYP — RT Russia & Former Soviet Union",
    "content": "Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky’s chief of staff, Andrey Yermak, was visibly shaken after US President Donald Trump publicly rejected Kiev’s portrayal of progress on a proposed peace plan with Russia, the New York Post reported on Tuesday. Yermak was in the middle of an interview with the outlet when Trump posted on Truth Social that he did not consider the proposal discussed in Geneva last week to be finalized. According to the report, Yermak had spent the previous 30 minutes portraying the document as a nearly completed joint Trump-Zelensky roadmap that could be signed over the Thanksgiving holiday. “Upon reading the full post, Yermak’s face dropped, apparently gutted by the news,”the New York Post wrote. Asked to comment, he reportedly requested 24 hours“to assess the new reality.” Trump stated that he would dispatch Army Secretary Dan Driscoll to continue talks with Kiev, while special envoy Steve Witkoff would engage with Moscow. The president added that he would meet with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky“soon, but ONLY when the deal to end this War is FINAL or, in its final stages.” Previous reports have suggested that Yermak is deeply unpopular among many in Trump’s circle and across the broader US political establishment. A source quoted by Politico in July described him as a“bipartisan irritator.” In Ukraine, Yermak has long been accused of wielding inappropriate influence over Zelensky and national policy. Following the recent indictment of long-time Zelensky associate Timur Mindich on charges of running a $100 million kickbacks scheme, several commentators alleged that Yermak may have had a leading role in the network and urged his removal. Last week, Witkoff reportedly canceled a planned meeting with Yermak after learning the extent of the corruption scandal engulfing Kiev.

    "title": "Migrants arrested for gang rape of Italian teen – media — RT World News",
    "content": "Three Moroccan men have been arrested in Italy on suspicion of raping an 18-year-old woman while forcing her fiancé to watch, local media reported on Tuesday, citing police in Rome. Two suspects were reportedly detained in the Italian capital and a third was apprehended in the northern city of Verona. Police are currently searching for others who may have been involved in the incident, which occurred in the Tor Tre Teste area on the outskirts of Rome on October 25. The couple was inside a parked vehicle when at least three men smashed a window and dragged them out, according to police, as cited by Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica. Two of the attackers allegedly pinned the 24-year-old man down while a third raped the woman. The suspects face charges of group sexual violence and robbery. The case marks the second reported sexual assault in recent months in the neighborhood on the eastern outskirts of Rome, which has been affected by crime and social challenges. In August, a 26-year-old Gambian man was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a 60-year-old woman. The man, who arrived in Italy as a migrant in 2016 and was granted humanitarian protection and permission to stay in 2023, reportedly told police he was under the influence of drugs at the time. The suspect is also under investigation for another alleged sexual assault that occurred several days earlier and faces prosecution for both incidents. Incidents involving migrants have long fueled public concern across Europe. In the UK, Spain, Sweden, Germany, and other countries, high-profile sexual assaults and violent crimes have sparked protests, political debate, and calls for stricter immigration and public-safety measures. The decades-long migrant crisis is largely driven by conflict, poverty, and political instability in regions such as the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. Western interventions, including local wars in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan, as well as support for uprisings in Syria, have exacerbated the conditions, destabilizing governments and fueling violence. Consequently, many people have been forced to flee, making current migration challenges partly a legacy of past foreign policies.

    "title": "A peace plan with 28 points and 100 pitfalls: What comes next for Ukraine? — RT Russia & Former Soviet Union",
    "content": "ByAnton Grishanov, Chief Research Fellow at the Institute for Contemporary International Issues of the Diplomatic Academy of the Russian Foreign Ministry At this point, it would be extremely presumptuous to predict the prospects of Donald Trump’s plan for Ukraine. The situation is changing at an astonishing rate. Such speed can lead to unexpected skids and drifts. The commotion surrounding the ultimately postponed summit in Budapest is still fresh in our minds. However, the current situation is different. For the first time since the conflict began, the US has put forward framework proposals that, while not exhaustive, consider Moscow’s standpoint on most issues. Of course, the Kremlin will not readily accept the 28 points – they require clarification and adjustment. This will necessitate a serious negotiation process to ensure that the future peace treaty does not suffer the same fate as Minsk-2. But several scenarios for this process are emerging, and not all of them are optimistic. In the simplest scenario, Trump threatens to cut off aid to Kiev, forcing the Kiev government to sign the document as it is, after which the Kremlin accepts it as a roadmap. This would only be the first step towards peace, however, as there are many pitfalls in the American proposals. These include the status of Kherson and Zaporozhye, how to resolve language and religious issues, and much more besides. Just one or two crises would be enough to resume military action with renewed vigor. For the plan to succeed, effective control mechanisms must be put in place – something that Vladimir Zelensky’s team has so far prevented. Consequently, the plan could be derailed at any moment. The second scenario involves Kiev refusing to approve the plan in its original form. With Western Europe’s support, Ukraine could declare its unwillingness to enshrine the country’s neutral status in the constitution, as well as its refusal to make territorial concessions. Washington’s attitude changes again, Russia is called upon to show flexibility, and the negotiations collapse. With Moscow again being blamed for this in Trump’s eyes. In this case, the US finally washes its hands of the matter and plays on the escalation. The White House returns to the issue of Tomahawk missiles, and the crisis enters an uncontrollable phase. Dialogue will not resume anytime soon, and negotiations will have to start from scratch. The third and most realistic scenario is for the parties to transition to a protracted negotiation model, strengthening their positions as they go. Zelensky is buying time while he desperately tries to negotiate compromises. Meanwhile, Moscow is taking advantage of this to advance its troops deeper into Ukraine. The US believes that negotiations are better than no negotiations and is patiently revising its plan. Western Europe is reluctantly accepting the new rules of the game. As a result, a new version of the document emerges that is acceptable to all parties. Of course, there is also a fourth option: a political crisis erupts in Kiev, the front line collapses and the West turns a blind eye as the Ukrainian project crumbles. Against the backdrop of recent events, this scenario seems more realistic than it did six months ago. However, neither the US nor Western Europe are ready to accept the loss of Ukraine today. It is, as they say, ‘too big to fail’. Therefore, it is not yet worth hoping for help from some ‘black swans’. The time has come for serious and thoughtful negotiations, in which Moscow has a clear advantage. Forcing opponents into diplomacy, which they have avoided for so long, will therefore be a step towards Russia achieving the goals of what’s known here as the“special military operation.”  This article was first published byKommersant, and was translated and edited by the RT team.

    "title": "Ukrainian corruption schemes could have beneficiaries in EU – Lavrov — RT Russia & Former Soviet Union",
    "content": "People in the EU could be benefitting from corruption in Ukraine, otherwise it’s difficult to explain the bloc’s determination to continue funding Kiev despite repeated graft and embezzling scandals, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview published on Tuesday. Brussels is seeking to“scrape”together €135 billion ($156 billion) to prop up Kiev through 2026 and 2027, either through direct money transfer from member states’ budgets, joint borrowing, or seizing frozen Russian assets. Moscow has warned that the third option would essentially amount to theft of its sovereign funds. “It was recently discovered that yet another $100 million were spent on bribes to the corrupt officials,”Lavrov told the French-Russian Dialogue Association.“Did anyone from the Brussels bureaucrats or from those nations that pump Ukraine full of money explain it to their taxpayers that they have to endure and suffer? Maybe, there are some beneficiaries as well. I rule out nothing.” The EU has not changed its plans, even in light of a recent major graft scandal that has rocked Ukraine. Earlier this month, Ukraine’s anti-corruption bodies revealed that a close associate and a former long-time business partner of Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky ran a $100 million kickback scheme in the energy sector, which heavily depends on Western aid. Just one day after news of the scandal broke, Germany announced that it would provide Ukraine with an additional €40 million ($46.22 million) to support its energy industry, which is at the center of the controversy. It was not the first high-profile corruption scandal in Ukraine. In 2023, then-Defense Minister Aleksey Reznikov resigned after the media exposed inflated food procurement contracts at his ministry. In 2024, the State Audit Service found large-scale violations in reconstruction projects financed by Western aid. Moscow warned in the wake of the latest scandal that a“many-headed bloody hydra”of Ukrainian corruption was stretching beyond the borders and draining Western taxpayers’ money.

    "content": "RT correspondent Murad Gadziev has taken footage at a section of the Ukrainian border with Russia’s Donetsk People’s Republic where Kiev’s troops had dug a large defensive trench — one that apparently failed to slow the latest Russian advances. The location lies near the village of Novopavlovka in Dnepropetrovsk Region. Gadziev became the first Russian journalist to report from the area during the ongoing conflict. The Russian Defense Ministry has repeatedly cited the settlement in recent briefings, noting that its forces have been consolidating gains in the area. There were no signs of Ukrainian activity along the trench line. Gatziev emphasized that his ability to be there safely underscored the extent of the Russian advance, since military officials would not have allowed a reporter into an area still considered dangerous. “The fact that we were allowed to come here ought to tell you how far frontline troops are.

    "title": "Russia and India to work on linking national payment systems – Moscow — RT India",
    "content": " Russia and India are keen to link their national payment systems, and the topic will be high on the agenda when President Vladimir Putin visits New Delhi in December, a senior Russian official has said. Indian Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar discussed the linking-up of Russia’s Mir and RuPay systems with Indian services when he met with Putin during his visit to Moscow earlier this month, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko told Izvestia on Monday. Since the imposition of Western sanctions on Russian banks, many visitors from the country are forced to use cash for payments in India. Indians visiting Russia also face a similar problem since international Mastercard and Visa cards do not work in the country. Moscow is hopeful that the countries can agree on the mutual recognition of the Mir and RuPay systems, Rudenko told the newspaper. ”This, of course, would contribute to a greater influx of Russian tourists to India, would help them navigate the country and purchase the services provided by our Indian friends,” he said.“We hope that this and other issues will be resolved.” The linking of Russian and Indian payment systems can be achieved relatively quickly on a limited scale, Izvestia cited Alexey Kupriyanov, head of the Center of the Indo-Pacific Region of the Primakov National Research Institute of World Economy and International Relations, as saying.“The next step is to pair SBP [Russia’s Faster Payments System] and UPI [India’s United Payments Interface], ideally to ensure that businesses can make mutual settlements through Mir and RuPay,”Kupriyanov told Izvestia. Such a link-up would eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce commissions on currency exchange by up to 30%, analysts told the paper. It would also enable Russians and Indians to make QR code and electronic wallet payments in each other’s countries, eliminating the need to even use credit cards. Russia and India have stepped up the use of the rupee and ruble for trade settlements, with 90% being made in national currencies, according to the paper. India also pays for Russian oil in currencies of countries that have friendly relations with Moscow. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025. All rights reserved.

    "title": "US wants Ukraine peace deal before security guarantees – Politico — RT World News",
    "content": "US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has told EU officials that Washington wants Ukraine to sign a peace deal before it agrees to any security guarantees, Politico reported on Wednesday, citing sources. Kiev has been seeking formal security assurances from its Western sponsors, and insists they should come before a peace agreement. Moscow has said it does not oppose security guarantees in principle, but insists they must not be one-sided or aimed at containing Russia, and should come after a peace deal, not before. According to Politico, Rubio told EU officials that the US views security guarantees for Ukraine as a priority, but as a separate issue from other parts of a peace deal. He reportedly signaled that US President Donald Trump will discuss the guarantees with Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky after Kiev approves the US peace plan proposed last week. According to leaked versions, the 28-pointplanrequires Kiev to abandon several long-standing“red lines,”including renouncing NATO membership, recognizing Russian sovereignty over Crimea and the Donbass republics, and capping its army at 600,000 troops. Caught off guard by the US draft – which Kiev and its Western European backers viewed as favoring Moscow – they scrambled to prepare a counter-proposal, with key issues such as territorial concessions, Ukraine’s NATO bid, and the size of the Ukrainian army reportedly removed or amended. The counter-proposal reportedly includes security guarantees for Ukraine modeled on NATO’s Article 5 collective-defense clause, committing guarantor states to defend Ukraine against potential aggression. Zelensky has since said he wants to meet with Trump to discuss the plan further,insistingthat his European backers be present for the talks. Trump has said he will meet with Zelensky when the peace deal is“in its final stages.” Moscow largely welcomed Trump’s peace proposal, saying it could serve as the basis for a final settlement, but accused Kiev’s European backers of trying to undermine peace efforts and distort the plan“for their own agenda.” Russia has said it is ready to discuss the US proposals. US special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to visit Moscow next week. RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025. All rights reserved. This website uses cookies.

    "title": "Here’s why nobody asked the EU when coming up with the Ukraine peace plan — RT World News",
    "content": "ByRachel Marsden, a columnist, political strategist, and host of independently produced talk-shows in French and English. ByRachel Marsden, a columnist, political strategist, and host of independently produced talk-shows in French and English. Someone leaked a 28-point peace plan for Ukraine, attributing it to the US and Russia. Apparently, no one bothered keeping the EU in the loop. But it wasn’t long before they were busy proving precisely why they’ve been avoided. But the screeching from the EU big top tent was so distracting that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had to go over to Geneva on Sunday in the same way that a parent has to go calm down their toddler having a tantrum in the supermarket aisle because everyone’s rolling their eyes and staring. The unelected European Commission President, ‘Queen’ Ursula von der Leyen,saidon Sunday that the EU’s“centrality”has to be recognized in any peace plan. And that“Ukraine must have the freedom and sovereign right to choose its own destiny. They have chosen a European destiny.” Who is she, Ukraine’s mom? Talk about helicopter parenting. Why did Queen Ursula say earlier in the week, in the immediate wake of the leak, that she was going to“reach out to Zelensky to discuss the matter”? She keeps saying that he’s a big boy, and that Ukraine is sovereign and independent. Which must be why she’s talking like she’s waiting for a phone call from a 12-year old to let her know what time he’s going to be home so he doesn’t break curfew. The EU was waiting by the phone alright–but it wasn’t ringing. European Council President Antonio Costahad saidthat he had no idea what was in the proposal because they hadn’t even been told about it. Well, now you know. Feel better? Of course not. Rubio had to go all the way over to Geneva to pay lip service to the idea that you jokers have anything to contribute beyond slogans and demands to pursue a course of war until you can get around to figuring out exactly how you can parlay that into profiting and sticking it to Putin. But what’s really the EU’s big fear with this new deal? That Ukraine is going to get shafted? Or that the European Union gets left out of a bargain in which everyone else profits and they get stuck with the bill. Deal points reportedly include mutual Russia-US ventures and profits as sanctions get dropped against Moscow, and the US getting dibs on Ukrainian reconstruction deals. And the only thing that it looks like the EU would get is the opportunity to donate $100 billion to Ukraine to put their money where their big mouth is. And then to continue to use that big mouth to keep whining about Russia after it has effectively become a business joint venture partner of Washington under this proposed new deal. Then there’s the German foreign minister who’s acting like the arbiter of what a real peace plan looks like. Because he’s done exactly how many of these?“From my point of view, it is not a real plan, but simply a list of topics,”Johann WadephultoldAFP.“It will be Ukraine that decides what compromises it makes,”he added.Like a college kid who 'decides' what courses to take while his parents either accept or refuse to let him live under their roof, right? Seems that the main talking point that went out to EU officials is that this proposed deal is 'about Ukraine without Ukraine,' some variation of which has been repeated by the likes of Queen Ursula,the Czech foreign minister, and his Norwegian counterpart. Quick question though, guys: Exactly how much free stuff does Ukraine have to get in before it’s finally about Ukraine? Christmas is 'about the children' because they’re the ones getting showered with cash by everyone else. Same with Kiev. One thing this peace deal isn’t about is Europe, though. So they’re trying to shoehorn themselves in.“Our position hasn’t changed,”saidEU chief diplomat Kaja Kallas.“For any peace plan to succeed, it has to be supported by Ukraine, and it has to be supported by Europe.” Your position hasn’t changed? You don’t say! The whole idea of a peace plan is to change the position – from war. So I guess perhaps that explains the lack of progress, huh? The Europeans are acting like Ukraine is part of the EU starter pack – conjoined twins, basically. Except the EU is whining way more than even the twin stuck living with some dude she didn’t even want to marry because her sister said yes. These people literally act like they’re at war with Russia themselves. Putin’s coming in 2030, they say. Gotta shove some tuna cans in your purse for an emergency and let the government blow all your tax money on weapons to prepare. Don’t want to? Well, guess you’d better just get ready to die for being too cheap, then! Is that not scary enough? Well then how about if the military industrial complex directly threatens your kids. Will that work? Looks like a top French general is giving that one a go.“All knowledge, all economic and demographic power must be directed toward containing the Moscow regime,”said General Fabien Mandon.“Our country could fail because it is unwilling to accept the loss of its children.” As you might imagine, this guy has totally inspired the French to go fight Russia just so the EU can avoid looking like the slackjawed idiot left holding the bag after the fighting ends. It’s clear that the EU leaders are banking on a war economy. So just imagine how much it would really suck for them if a peace economy suddenly broke out with prearranged business deals – and the only thing left for Europe is the opportunity to blow all the billions that they promised to Ukraine with no clear return on investment. What a downer peace would be for them at the very moment that European defense giant, Airbus Group,has just startedusing the conflict as a pretext to peddle the idea of churning out nuclear weapons for Europe, whose delivery systems Airbus is involved in making. Why should the tank and missile makers and bomb shelter peddlers have all the fun? Why can’t nukes get in on the grift? That should be great for humanity in the long run. Adding insult to injury, Poland says that it’ll buy $100 million worth of weapons for Ukraine. From the US. The EU wants to call the shots to Moscow and Washington, but can’t even manage to avoid getting cucked by the Poles as they hop into bed with the US weapons industry to the detriment of Europe’s own. For the EU, this is less about Ukraine and more about not being the schmuck stuck holding everyone else’s shopping bags during the post-war clearance sale.

    "title": "Gaza in worst economic collapse on record – UN — RT World News",
    "content": "Gaza is suffering the worst economic collapse on record after two years of war between Israel and Hamas have left the Palestinian enclave devastated, according to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report. The UN trade body said this week that GDP in 2024 crashed by 83% from the previous year, while GDP per capita fell to $161 for the year – less than 50 cents a day – among the lowest levels in the world. UNCTAD estimates the economy has shrunk to just 13% of its 2022 size, with inflation at 238%, unemployment near 80%, and all 2.3 million residents pushed below the poverty line. “The post-October 2023 military operations have destroyed the economic foundations of Gaza and propelled it from de-development to utter ruin,”UNCTAD wrote, adding that the crisis has erased 69 years of progress and plunged the enclave’s economy into“the most severe crisis ever recorded.” About 70% of all structures in the enclave have been damaged, and rebuilding Gaza will cost at least $70 billion and take decades, according to the report. The two years of fighting and restrictions have also driven a sharp contraction across the wider Palestinian economy, with the West Bank also sliding into its most severe downturn on record, UNCTAD said. Israel launched its military campaign in the Palestinian enclave in response to a surprise attack by Hamas in October 2023, which killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. The Hamas-run Gaza health authorities report that the ensuing Israeli operations have killed more than 69,500 Palestinians. A US-brokered ceasefire, which took effect in Gaza on October 10, called for Israeli forces to pull back from parts of the enclave and for Hamas to free the last 20 remaining living Israeli hostages in exchange for about 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. However, Israeli airstrikes have continued despite the truce, while aid deliveries have increased only slowly, leaving conditions on the ground dire, according to UN agencies and regional mediators.

    "title": "Arrests in South Africa over G20 thefts and protests — RT Africa",
    "content": "South African police have arrested 13 people in Gauteng following 14 reported incidents during the recent G20 Summit in Johannesburg, including violent protests and thefts targeting international delegates. The information was disclosed during a post-G20 summit media briefing on Monday, November 25, led by Gauteng Premier Panyaza Lesufi in Johannesburg. He was joined by several Members of the Mayoral Committee (MMCs). The summit, held over the weekend, ran from November 22 to 23 at the Nasrec Expo Centre. Lesufi said there were a number of disruptions and crimes reported during the event. ”You all know, South Africans being South Africans, there was no way that we would not have problems,” Lesufi said. “We can report the following disturbing incidents that happened in our province during this period under review.”He said that there was a theft of cell phones and luggage from delegates representing Vietnam at Checkers Sandton City Mall. Four suspects were immediately arrested. At DaVinci Hotel, one suspect was arrested for possession of a firearm without proper authorisation. At Mercure Hotel in Ferndale, police investigated the theft of a firearm from a member of the SAPS, as well as possession of ammunition and negligent loss of a firearm. Two suspects were arrested in connection with these incidents. Lesufi said that between November 17 and 20, a total of 1,799 people were arrested across Gauteng. The arrests included suspects wanted for vandalising infrastructure, as well as serious crimes such as theft, kidnapping, intimidation, and extortion. ”Among these, 1,075 cases were for contact crimes, which include assault, rape, murder, attempted murder, and house robberies,” Lesufi said. He also detailed additional incidents, including trespassing by a group attempting to raid the centre, a case of intimidation on November 7, and a dispute involving two Brazilian pilots and two women in Kempton Park that police helped resolve. A car hijacking incident also occurred, in which a suspect attempted to hijack a police vehicle using a toy gun. He said the police managed the situation without injury. Meanwhile, Gauteng Provincial Police Commissioner Lieutenant General Tommy Mthombeni confirmed the arrests linked to the G20. He said that while 14 cases were reported, multiple arrests were connected to individual incidents. Mthombeni said that pointing to the Sandton Mall theft as an example. ”We systematically tracked the suspects and arrested them in Honeydew, linking them to other crimes,” Mthombeni said. He added that law enforcement agencies implemented multiple operations, including Operation Shanela 2, in the run-up to and during the summit to ensure public safety across the province’s five districts. During the summit, coordinated operational plans were executed to manage security at major roads, hotels, and public areas. Mthombeni praised the joint effort of law enforcement, saying it ensured that incidents were quickly addressed and no major injuries occurred. Among some of those arrested include two members of Operation Dudula who were protesting near where the summit was being held. Police arrested two men, aged 46 and 54, after a police officer was injured and taken to a nearby medical facility during a violent protest. The incident occurred on Saturday, November 22, the first day of the summit. This comes after Operation Dudula leader Zandile Dabula was hit with tear gas and pepper spray as SAPS officers confronted protesters. The police pushed back a group of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) members and Operation Dudula activists who had gathered near the heavily fortified venue, demanding to speak to President Cyril Ramaphosa and visiting dignitaries. Officers deployed tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the crowd, and water cannons were positioned at the scene. The police have since opened a case of public violence, assault of a police officer and contravention of a court order against Operation Dudula.

    "title": "‘Legally impossible’ to sign peace treaty with Ukraine now – Putin — RT Russia & Former Soviet Union",
    "content": "Sealing a peace accord with Ukraine is“legally impossible”at present, Russian President Vladimir Putin has stated. While Moscow would like to ink such an agreement eventually, the current Ukrainian leadership has lost all legitimacy by canceling elections, Putin told reporters on Thursday. Wrapping up his state visit to Kyrgyzstan Putin stated that“it makes no sense to sign documents with the Ukrainian leadership – I have covered this topic many times already.” According to the Russian president,“the Ukrainian leadership made a fundamental, strategic mistake, when it was afraid to hold elections.” Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky“lost his legitimate status”as the country’s president, Putin pointed out. Under Ukrainian law, presidential elections should have been held in May 2024; however, Zelensky refused to hold them, citing martial law. Moscow has considered him an illegitimate leader since. Putin noted that while Russia is also locked in a military conflict, it nevertheless held presidential elections in March 2024. The Russian president said that should any peace agreement be signed, the Ukrainian leadership would have to lift martial law and“immediately call elections.”However, as things stand at present,“the Ukrainian leadership could hardly count on an [electoral] victory without rigging”the vote, Putin observed. Earlier this month, the administration of US President Donald Trump put forth a framework for a peace plan aimed at ending the Ukraine conflict. According to leaked versions published by several media outlets, the 28-point proposal envisages Ukraine abandoning a number of its long-standing“red lines.” Kiev would reportedly be required to renounce its NATO membership aspirations, as well as its claims to Russia’s Crimea and the Donbass regions of Lugansk and Donetsk, to limit the size of its military to 600,000, among other points. Moscow has stated that while it has yet to receive any official documents, it welcomes the general impetus. Russian officials have tentatively said that the US-drafted framework could serve as the basis for a final settlement. US special envoy Steve Witkoff is expected to visit Moscow next week.

    "title": "Why the G20 both lost and found its way — RT Africa",
    "content": "ByVsevolod Sviridov, deputy director, expert at the Centre for African Studies, Higher School of Economics, Moscow ByVsevolod Sviridov, deputy director, expert at the Centre for African Studies, Higher School of Economics, Moscow On November 30, 2025, South Africa’s G20 presidency will conclude. This year was unique in the history of the intergovernmental forum, since it was the first time an African nation held the presidency. Despite challenging global circumstances, South Africa hosted over 130 events throughout the year focused on various issues like debt management, the energy transition, essential minerals, food security, and enhancing dialogue between the G20 and African countries. South Africa’s eventful presidency culminated in the G20 summit held November 22-23 in Johannesburg. A major result of the summit was the adoption of a final declaration. South African diplomacy was able to achieve consensus among a diverse group of G20 member states on complex topics such as Ukraine and Palestine. The declaration was a substantive document that placed a strong emphasis on African interests, with sections dedicated to food security, energy, clean cooking, and capital outflow. While the media often focuses on the summit itself – essentially a brief concluding event attended by heads of state – the results of South Africa’s G20 presidency may be best analyzed by looking at the events organized throughout the year. South Africa prioritized engagement with African nations, particularly focusing on the continent’s pressing debt crisis and access to financing. Many of South Africa’s initiatives are process-driven and their effectiveness is not immediately quantifiable – in this context, the development of frameworks is more important. One significant initiative launched by South Africa is the Expert Task Force, which will analyze the cost of capital for developing countries (primarily in Africa). This recognition at the G20 level acknowledges that the risks associated with developing jurisdictions are often overestimated, leading to higher interest rates for countries in need of stable, long-term financing. The focus on Africa is reflected not only in South Africa’s G20 presidency but also in the continent’s increasingly influential role in global politics and economics. For a long time, South Africa was the only African country with permanent representation in the G20. However, since 2023, the African Union has been granted full membership, and several other organizations, including NEPAD, have been regularly invited to G20 summits. South Africa also invited traditional ‘African heavyweights’ Nigeria and Egypt to take part in many of the G20 events which it organized. Regional integration bodies as well as multilateral and pan-African banks and organizations – such as the African Development Bank, COMESA, EAC, ECCAS, SADC, and others – were also involved. In this context, South Africa’s presidency has been successful, particularly in advancing its own foreign policy goals and the interests of the Global South. It has unified the African continent and presented an agenda aligned with the interests of African nations, while maintaining the overall focus on developing countries that was set by Indonesia, India, and Brazil, which held the G20 presidency in 2022-24. Through these efforts, South Africa has reaffirmed its status as a leader on the African continent and a significant player in international relations. South Africa’s G20 presidency, like that of its predecessors, occurred at a particularly challenging time. When the group was established in 1999 at the level of finance ministers in the wake of the Asian financial crisis, its primary aim was to bridge the gap between the West and the East. The G7, which comprises the largest industrialized economies, was unable to adequately represent the interests of China, Russia, India, Brazil, South Africa, and other leaders from the developing world, leading to the creation of the G20. Its goal was to modernize and optimize the system of international economic relations amid the transformations of the late 20th century. However, by the mid-2020s, the international political and economic landscape had changed fundamentally. The economic order that the G20 was supposed to support failed to meet the needs of developing nations. Western countries were unwilling to give up their positions in key international financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank. Disagreements emerged within the World Trade Organization, competition intensified over value chains, critical minerals, and climate policies. Moreover, this system began to displease some developed countries, particularly the US. The world has entered a phase of fragmentation, with tensions escalating between China and the US, the US and Russia, China and the EU, as well as between China and India. Fractures in America’s relationships with its longstanding partners in Europe and Asia have become evident. This inevitably hampers the effectiveness of the G20, which relies heavily on the ability of major players to reach compromises. Notably, the 2025 summit was not attended by the leaders of the US (the American delegation was absent entirely), Russia, or China. Officially, the US attributed its absence to the excessively ‘ideological’ and ‘leftist’ agenda – claims that did not hold up under scrutiny. However, the real issue lies not just in the deteriorating US-South Africa relations, but also in Washington’s waning interest in maintaining the ‘rules-based order’ it once championed. Looking ahead, next year will be telling for the future of the G20 when the presidency shifts back to the US. It will reveal how invested Washington is in the format, how actively it engages, and what initiatives it introduces. The crisis in multilateral institutions is glaring: The WTO has been paralyzed, the UN faces significant internal constraints, and both the IMF and the World Bank remain rigid to reform. Even BRICS has somewhat slowed its activities as it grapples with expansion and adapts to a new format. In these circumstances, regional cooperation is becoming increasingly vital. While South Africa’s presidency may not have catalyzed reconsolidation on a global scale, it has certainly succeeded in turning the G20 into a platform for discussing issues pertinent to Africa and, more broadly, the Global South. This groundwork can be leveraged within regional economic communities, the African Union, and other organizations. In the face of the crisis of globalization and the self-centeredness of once-dominant players, regionalization might emerge as a key driver of growth for developing countries.

    "title": "‘No one listens’ to Europe on Ukraine – Lavrov — RT Russia & Former Soviet Union",
    "content": "Europe has no place in talks about settling the Ukraine conflict because it insists on using Kiev as a proxy to try to defeat Russia, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in an interview on Tuesday. Speaking with the France-Russia Dialogue Association, Lavrov accused“European elites”of long wishing Russia“harm and misfortune,”citing an“aggressiveness with a Russophobic tint”that he said continues to dominate Western Europe’s ruling class. Lavrov’s remarks follow reports that the US drafted a roadmap for ending the hostilities. The initial outlines surfaced in US media, with a Ukrainian MP and Axios later publishing what they said were the full 28 points, which include Ukraine abandoning its NATO ambitions, relinquishing parts of the new Russian regions still under its control, and capping the size of its army. Germany, France, and the UK reportedly drafted their own version of the plan over the weekend, removing or softening several of the most controversial points. Politico and other outlets reported, however, that US diplomats told EU counterparts the core negotiation track remains Washington-Kiev-Moscow. Russia has already signaled it finds the European proposal“completely unconstructive”and prefers the terms of the US plan. A number of European leaders and institutions have pushed back, insisting any deal must include both Ukraine and the EU itself and cannot impose territorial or security concessions. Lavrov, however, suggested these opinions should not be taken into account due to the bloc’s war-mongering stance. “These elites opted for war... No one listens to [them] because the European elites placed their bets on their conviction that they could use the Nazi regime in Kiev as a proxy and cannon fodder to inflict what they call a strategic defeat on Russia,”Lavrov stated. He also noted that the EU lacks credibility given that the bloc often engages in contradictory rhetoric. Officials insist that Russia is close to defeat yet simultaneously warn that it will inevitably attack Western Europe once the Ukraine conflict ends. “All this demonstrates their confusion. They do not know what to do. They probably risk losing power if they radically change their rhetoric,”Lavrov suggested. Lavrov added that Russia’s relationship with the EU“will never be the same”as before the escalation of the Ukraine conflict, adding that if“the EU elites hope that we will come running once they express their readiness to sit down with Russia at the negotiating table, this will not happen.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.

    "title": "Russia producing arms at volumes its adversaries ‘could not dream of’ – Rostec CEO — RT Russia & Former Soviet Union",
    "content": "Russia’s defense industry is producing weapons at volumes its adversaries“could not even dream of,”Sergey Chemezov, the head of state-owned defense conglomerate Rostec, said in an interview published on Tuesday. Chemezov told TASS news agency that Russia has sharply ramped up arms output since the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022 and is now manufacturing more artillery shells and aerial bombs than any other country. ”We are supplying aircraft, tanks, infantry vehicles, howitzers, electronic warfare systems, drones and much more in enormous quantities. No country in the world today produces as many shells and aerial bombs,”he said. ”I can’t give specific figures, of course. So I will put it this way: our adversaries could not have dreamed of such volumes,”the Rostec chief added. Russian officials have repeatedly highlighted rising defense output over the past three years. In May 2024, President Vladimir Putin said the country’s ammunition production had increased fourteenfold during the special military operation, while drone manufacturing had quadrupled and armored weapons output had risen 3.5 times. Russia has consistently denounced Western arms deliveries to Ukraine, warning they only prolong the conflict without altering its outcome. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov reiterated on Tuesday that Russia is interested in achieving its goals“through political and diplomatic means,”saying:“We remain fully open to a negotiating process.” However, Moscow says Kiev,“is only seeking to keep the fighting going,”encouraged by its Western backers. It has also accused the EU and UK of impeding ongoing peace efforts. The UK discouraged early peace negotiations between Moscow and Kiev in 2022, according to David Arakhamia, head of Vladimir Zelensky’s parliamentary bloc and former chief negotiator, who said then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged Kiev to abandon the talks, a claim Johnson has denied.

    "title": "Russian negotiator on Ukraine denies phone call leak — RT Russia & Former Soviet Union",
    "content": "Russia’s investment envoy and negotiator on Ukraine, Kirill Dmitriev, has said the transcript of his alleged phone call published by Bloomberg is false. On Tuesday, Bloomberg claimed that it obtained a recording of Dmitriev’s short conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aide, Yury Ushakov, on October 29. The publication did not release the audio but posted the transcript in Russian and English. Commenting on the story on X, Dmitriev wrote“fake.”He previously accused the Western media of spreading disinformation in an attempt to derail US President Donald Trump’s efforts to mediate peace between Russia and Ukraine. In Bloomberg’s transcript, a person labeled as ‘Dmitriev’ is shown saying he would“make this paper from our position”and“informally pass it along.” Last week, the White House confirmed that it drafted a peace plan, which critics claim favors Russia. The EU has since presented a counterproposal, while US and Ukrainian officials met on Sunday to further discuss Trump’s draft. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday that the draft was leaked to create“media hype”aimed at undermining US President Donald Trump’s mediation efforts. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the public speculation about the negotiations as“a travesty,”adding that Moscow“does not engage in megaphone diplomacy.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.

    "title": "Tunisia summons EU ambassador — RT Africa",
    "content": "Tunisian President Kais Saied has summoned the European Union’s ambassador in the North African country to“strongly protest”the alleged breach of diplomatic protocol by the official. The move came a day after Ambassador Giuseppe Perrone met Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT) chief Noureddine Taboubi, at a time of tensions between the powerful trade union and the government over labor rights and economic reforms. Perrone hailed the UGTT for“supporting social dialogue and economic development in Tunisia”and said strengthening partnership with the organization was essential during the talks on Monday, his office said. In a statement published early Wednesday, Saied said he called in Perrone on Tuesday“regarding the failure to comply with the rules of diplomatic conduct and dealings outside the official frameworks recognized in diplomatic customs”in his capacity as EU ambassador to Tunisia. No further details were given on the actions that prompted the complaint. Perrone, an Italian diplomat, has served as EU envoy to Tunisia since September 2024. This is not the first time the Tunisian authorities have confronted an EU diplomat. In 2019, then Ambassador Patrice Bergamini was summoned by the Foreign Ministry to explain comments he made about entrenched economic monopolies in Tunisia in an interview with French daily Le Monde. The EU is Tunisia’s largest financial partner, providing nearly €1.8 billion (about $2.0 billion) in funding since 2013. However, relations between Tunis and Brussels have been uneasy since 2023. Tensions have been fueled in part by a partnership agreement under which the EU pledged more than €1 billion to support Tunisia’s battered economy and curb irregular migration from the country’s coast to Europe. The bloc later announced that it would disburse €127 million in aid to the country, with most of the funds earmarked for migration-related measures, including facilitating the deportation of migrants to their home countries. President Saied publiclyrejectedthe“small amount,”declaring that his government would not accept“anything that resembles charity or handouts.” RT News App © Autonomous Nonprofit Organization “TV-Novosti”, 2005–2025.

    "title": "Politics latest: Starmer challenged over 'misleading the public' with budget tax rises | Politics News | Sky News",
    "content": "The prime minister has denied breaking Labour's manifesto pledge with budget tax hikes. But in an interview with Sky News, he acknowledged asking \"everybody to contribute\". Watch below. Thursday 27 November 2025 16:05, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player In the budget yesterday, a whole host of tax measures were changed. A lot of these are complicated and many have initials for names. Luckily, our colleagues over in the Money Blog know their Air Passenger Duty from their ISA threshold limits, so have done the hard work for you. Following the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) accidentally releasing details of the budget almost an hour before Rachel Reeves stood up yesterday, the financial watchdog said it would start an investigation. We've now got a bit more on that. In a document published on their website, the OBR says the investigation will be carried out \"swiftly\" to provide answers to the chancellor, Treasury, and MPs by Monday 1 December - four days time. Any report will also be published, the organisation confirms. This is so the various groups can \"be informed of the facts of what\nhappened and the further actions that need to be taken in response at the earliest possible\nopportunity\". Here is the moment it happened, in case you missed it: The watchdog says that members of the independent oversight board, Baroness Sarah Hogg and Dame Susan Rice, will lead the investigation. They will be helped by Ciaran Martin, the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, as well as IT experts in the Treasury. According to the document published by the OBR, the terms of reference will include: • Establish the events that made it possible to access the EFO early. • Determine the actions needed to assure the Oversight Board, the Chancellor, the Treasury and the Commons Treasury Committee that no future breaches of forecast security will take place. • Set a timeline for implementing those actions. • Make other recommendations to the OBR in light of its findings, as it sees fit. You can also watch the moment the head of the OBR, Richard Hughes, apologised and said he felt \"mortified\" by the incident. The prime minister, the chancellor and the energy secretary have been on a joint visit to a community centre in Rugby today. They have been chatting to people at the Benn Partnership Centre, where they've been talking up how the budget will help with the cost of living. The chancellor's budget, which she unveiled yesterday, raised taxes by more than £26bn, and even Rachel Reeves has admitted it means \"working people will pay more\". But the PM has denied it means Labour has breached their manifesto commitments. Speaking to Sky News, Sir Keir Starmer insisted that the chancellor \"kept to our manifesto\" - but refused to rule out more tax rises in the future. Among the cost-cutting measures include scrapping the two-child benefit cap, £150 off people's energy bills and freezing train fares in England, as well as the cost of prescriptions. The Tories have called on Reeves to resign - but she has insisted she is going nowhere. Have a look at some more photos from their visit below... What we saw during a visit in Rugby today was a rarity, an impassioned Sir Keir Starmer who really did want to \"take the argument on and argue about the choices he made at the heart\" of the budget, ourpolitical editor Beth Rigbysays. In his first interview with Sky News since the budget, Beth asked the PM whether he had misled the public by insisting a Labour government would not raise taxes on working people. Even the chancellor has openly admitted that her budget means \"working people will pay more\". But Starmer denied he had misled the public. \"This budget, the government has clearly made different choices for different reasons,\" Beth says. She adds: \"What I was trying to do in that interview was to try and get the prime minister to acknowledge that and explain it. \"But what he actually did was, he said, 'I haven't broken my manifesto promises', and he stuck with the line, really, that they have asked people to contribute more.\" Beth says she believes there is a \"question about accountability\" because she says, regardless of whether you agree with those decisions, there's a question about \"what they told voters in the run-up to the general election and beyond\". The PM was \"very clear\" 18 months ago that the government couldn't afford to lift the two-child benefit cap, and didn't put it in the manifesto. But, of course, all this has now changed. Beth also says the government is in a \"difficult position\" because Labour MPs really like this policy and Starmer gave an \"impassioned defence of why he had done that there\". But, she adds, \"the fact remains that he is raising taxes on those working people in the squeezed middle that he said he wouldn't\". Beth says he is doing this to carry out policies that \"please his party\" in order to \"buy some time and get some relief from the political pressure they're under\". But this change in direction also brought out a \"prime minister that's prepared to take on that fight, prepared to argue the case\". Summing up, she says: \"I do think there's an accountability question, but I also think the prime minister wanted to make the argument and put his shoulder to the wheel.\" By Hannah Woodward, political news editor Eluned Morgan's government in Wales has lost a vote in the Senedd over Rachel Reeves's budget. The Labour Welsh government lost a vote after opposition members combined forces to challenge the UK government's budget. The Conservative-led motion, endorsed by Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats, charged Sir Keir Starmer's government with \"failing the people of Wales\". Reeves's budget promised an extra £505m for Wales over the rest of the parliament, an end to the two-child benefit limit. But there was also a freeze in income tax thresholds - meaning more people in Wales will go into higher tax bands as their wages increase. The Welsh Conservatives said: \"Labour's claim that they wouldn't raise taxes on working people has been exposed for the second budget in a row.\" Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru warned that \"the Treasury continues to withhold over £4bn owed to Wales in transport funding\". Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth added: \"There was no action on increased national insurance or inheritance tax costs, which are pushing the Welsh public and private sectors to breaking point.\" Unlike her political opponents, the first minister welcomed Reeves's budget, saying it \"will mean more money in the pocket of people who need it the most, support for energy bills, a raise in the minimum wage and good news for pensioners\". The Tory motion passed narrowly, 25–24, marking the Welsh government's first defeat since Labour lost a seat to Plaid Cymru in the Caerphilly by‑election. Big challenges ahead for Welsh Labour With only 28 members, Labour now needs support from at least two opposition MS's to push decisions through. Although the vote on Reeves's budget was purely symbolic and carries no direct impact for Wales, it signals deeper challenges ahead for Morgan. One of the next big battles for her and Welsh Labour will be getting the Welsh government’s own budget passed, which is due in January. A huge vote is scheduled in Wales in the new year, when the Welsh government will present its spending plans for the next financial year. Should Labour's Senedd members fail to secure opposition support and reach an agreement, there would be automatic cuts. Opposition parties have made clear they hope to avoid that outcome. The Welsh government is currently holding talks with the Welsh Conservatives, the sole Welsh Liberal Democrat MS, and an Independent MS to secure support for the budget. So far, no agreements have been reached with any of these parties. Mike Tapp has welcomed new figures out today that show net migration to the UK has fallen to its lowest level since 2021. The migration minister said this is a \"positive sign we've dome down from that peak of around 944,000 under the last government\". Data from the Office for National Statistics shows net migration is 204,000 in the year to June. Tapp said: \"It's about bringing back that order, that control and ensuring that legal migration isn't an open door, which is what we saw in the last government, so that British workers aren't being undercut. \"But we've still got a long way to go, both on legal and illegal migration.\" Tapp was asked if the Tories should be given some credit for this, given they introduced a number of measures to deter legal migration before the 2024 election. Former home secretary James Cleverly has taken responsibility for the figures, saying they are \"down because of the visa regime that I put in place\". But the minister insists that \"this is a Labour government, it has been for the last 18 months\". He added: \"It was the Conservatives that gave us open borders on illegal migration, 400 crossed in 2018 that then led to over 150,000 coming in on boats. And then when it comes to legal migration, nearly a million in a year, undercutting British workers because a lot of that was low skilled labour. \"So, we do not thank the Conservatives for that and we'll continue down this path to bring migration down.\" Reform UK has hit out at the government for the \"largest exodus of people since the 1920s\". The party, more widely known for criticising the number of people coming into the UK, have been responding to new figures that show net migration has fallen to a four-year low, and reduced by 69% over the last year. For context: Net migration is the total number of people who have moved to the UK (immigration), minus the total number of people who have left the UK for other countries (emigration). It has been falling for two years, and both the Tories and Labour have claimed credit. But responding to the news, the party's head of policy, Zia Yusuf, said: \"There is no better example of Labour’s warped priorities than today's migration figures. \"693,000 people left the UK in the year to June, mainly caused by the largest exodus of people since the 1920s. That number is likely to increase further following the disastrous budget yesterday.\" Yusuf also hit out at separate figures, also released this morning, showing that the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has increased - despite a government pledge to end their use altogether. Yusuf said: \"The number of people housed in migrant hotels has grown a staggering 23 per cent since the election and there was a record number of asylum claims last year. \"Reform is the only party that wants to secure our borders, bring an end to mass immigration and deport those here illegally.\" Net migration has fallen, but new data out today shows that the government \"still needs to get a grip on small boat arrivals\", the Liberal Democrats have warned. Figures from the ONS show net migration has fallen to its lowest level in four years. But data also reveals that small boat arrivals were up 53% in the year to September 2025, compared to the previous 12 months. It also showed a 13% rise in the number of asylum seekers staying in hotels in September, compared to June. This is despite the government pledging to completely end the use of these by 2029. Max Wilkinson, the party's home affairs spokesperson, said: \" These figures show that the government still needs to get a grip on small boat arrivals and the use of asylum hotels. \"The OBR has warned that, without action, taxpayers face more than £1bn of extra pressure on the Home Office budget before the end of this parliament. \"The government promised to end hotel use and reduce spending - yet still has no credible plan to do so. \"The Liberal Democrats have set out a clear plan to cut the backlog and end hotel use within six months, using Nightingale-style processing centres. \"We would also lift the ban on asylum seekers working so they can support themselves, integrate and pay taxes.\" Downing Street has rejected predictions by the OBR that rolling out the government's digital ID scheme will cost £1.8bn over three years. In September, Sir Keir Starmer formally announced that anybody who wishes to work in the UK will require a form of government-issued digital ID. In practice, that means that almost every adult in the UK will need a form of digital ID. The PM also said this would be in place by 2029. In its analysis of the chancellor's budget, the OBR has concluded that the scheme will cost almost £2bn - across three years. But Downing Street has rejected this suggestion. A spokesperson for Number 10 said: \"The number in OBR forecast was an initial early assessment spread over a number of years. \"We do not recognise it as accurate as the programme, the scope of which is yet to be decided, let alone costed. \"Any costs in the review period will be met within existing settlements. The government will run a full consultation in due course.\" Now the dust has settled in the budget, what happens now - watch this video here to find out: Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has defended the budget's gambling tax hike in the Commons, saying the government sought to limit the economic impact. Nandy said she had worked closely with the Chancellor to \"ensure that the measures that she announced yesterday protect people who gathered great joy from an industry that is worth huge amounts to the UK economy\". The measures, which will fund the removal of the two-child benefit cap, were \"not a signal\" to the sector but a necessary choice to make a \"significant dent\" in child poverty, Nandy said. The chancellor had announced a raise of taxes on online gaming and betting, in a move set to raise £1.1 billion by 2029. This includes a rise of the remote gaming duty applying to online games from 21% to 40% next year. Taxes on online sports betting – excluding horseracing – will increase from 15% to 25% from April 2027. Nandy said the government was still seeking to shield high street businesses, such as bingo halls and pubs, and had lowered business rates for retail and hospitality properties to that effect.  ",

Scotland reporter@Jenster13 Thursday 27 November 2025 13:20, UK A rapist described as having \"a sense of entitlement to sex\" has been jailed for 10 years. Steven Mitchell, 41, denied any wrongdoing but was last month found guilty of six offences, including rape and sexual assault, following a trial at the High Court in Livingston,Scotland. The crimes were carried out against two women in West Lothian between 2016 and 2022. At his sentencing on Wednesday, Judge Susan Craig said a criminal justice social work report described Mitchell's sexual offending as \"chronic with a sense of entitlement to sex\". \"The report also expresses concern about your refusal to acknowledge that you have committed any aspect of these offences and that you are unlikely to want to change your behaviour,\" she said. The court also heard he made threats of violence against the victims, with the report describing him as high risk of sexual reoffending. Mitchell was handed a 13-year extended sentence - 10 years in prison and three years on licence once released back into the community. He was also placed on the sex offenders' register indefinitely.

    "content": "The prime minister said there was \"more to do on the plan\" in the coming days and the focus now was to try to make progress in Geneva. Political editor@BethRigby Saturday 22 November 2025 19:51, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Keir Starmer flies out of South Africa this evening with two massive issues on his agenda - a potentially manifesto-busting budget and, as it stands, an unacceptable Ukrainian peace deal. As he prepared to depart for London, theprime ministerconfirmed he was dispatching national security adviser Jonathan Powell to Geneva for talks with US officials, other European security advisers and Ukrainian representatives - as Europe and Ukraine scramble to reinsert themselves into a plan drawn up between Washington and Moscow. The prime minister said on Saturday there was \"more to do on the plan\" in the coming days and the focus now was to try to make progress in Geneva. Follow the latest:European leaders raise concerns over plan for Ukraine  Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  After speaking on the phone to Donald Trump, Downing Street said the pair agreed their teams would work together on the US leader's proposal in the Swiss city on Sunday. Starmer also reiterated Britain's \"steadfast support for Ukraine\" in a call with President Zelenskyy - as allies try to swing this deal more inUkraine's favour, with the UK and other international leaders clear on their concerns to limit the size of the Ukrainian army and give up territory toRussia. Be the first to getBreaking News Install the Sky News app for free But in his remarks on camera, the prime minister was at pains to neither criticise the current deal norPresident Trump. One figure told me that the PM wants to act as a bridge between the Europeans and the US and has been playing a \"game of whack-a-mole\" over the past couple of days in an effort to keep others from publicly saying the deal is unacceptable for fear it would only serve to irritate President Trump and hurt Ukraine. Earlier, the prime minister said he would talk to his US counterpart in the coming days. \"I'm absolutely clear in my mind that President Trump wants a just and lasting peace, not just from the actions he's taken towards that end, but also from the private discussions that I've had with him,\" Mr Starmer said. \"So I know what he's trying to achieve. We all want to achieve that.\" But there will be a question about what the alternative options are if allies cannot improve this deal by President Trump's Thursday deadline. The first option is to try to improve it and also slow down the process and buy more time, but if that fails, are allies looking at scenarios where they try to shore up Ukraine's war efforts without the US support? The prime minister responded by talking about point five in the 28-point plan, in which Ukraine is offered security guarantees from the US.

    "title": "Budget tax threshold freeze: Use our calculator to see how much more you will pay | UK News | Sky News",
    "content": "Rachel Reeves extended the freeze on tax thresholds for a further three years. She's also announced a change to tax rules on pension contributions. Find out what those changes mean for your take-home pay with our calculators. Senior data journalist@danieljdunford Thursday 27 November 2025 15:07, UK The freezing of tax thresholds is described as a \"stealth tax\". You won't notice any changes on your payslip right away, but as your pay goes up over the next few years as you receive pay rises, you will end up paying more. A smaller proportion of your wages will be tax-free, and higher earners will have to pay more of their salary at higher rates of tax. People whose current annual earnings are closest to the various thresholds - for example the £12,570 tax-free personal allowance, or the £50,270 limit before you start paying higher-rate tax - are hit hardest in relative terms. See how you will be affected with our calculator and scroll further down the page for our pensions tax calculator: The freezing of tax thresholds means Chancellor Rachel Reeves can technically keep to Labour's manifesto promise not to raise the rates of income tax, national insurance or VAT paid by working people over the course of this parliament. But will voters see it that way as the actual rates of tax paid on their earnings rise? Read more:Reeves says \"working people will pay a bit more\" - but denies a \"specific\" manifesto breach\"Sticking to Labour manifesto pledge costs millions of workers\", Resolution Foundation saysKeir Starmer performance tracker: Is the PM making progress towards his key policies? Low earners will lose a higher proportion of their earnings to direct taxation than they have done since 2013, by the time the current freeze ends in 2031. High earners are expected to hit their highest rates since 2008. The OBR says one in four adults will be higher-rate taxpayers by 2031, up from one in seven in 2022. That represents an additional 5.7 million people, including 920,000 dragged into the higher-rate band as a result of Reeves's latest three-year extension. Average earners are affected less, comparatively, as they sit more comfortably between the basic-rate and higher-rate tax bands. In September, average earnings were £733 a week (£38,136 a year), according to the ONS. The average worker now pays 18.8% in tax, compared with 18.2% when Labour took office. That is projected to reach 19.8% by March 2031. That would be the highest percentage since the national insurance rate was lowered under the Sunak/Hunt government in 2023. But the amount paid by average earners since April 2024 has been lower than at any previous point of the 21st century. Pensions tax raid The chancellor also announced changes to pension rules yesterday, meaning that people will start paying additional national insurance if their salary sacrifice pension contributions amount to more than £2,000 a year. See how you will be affected by that with our calculator: If you earn £40,000 a year and sacrifice 5% of that to your pension, you won't be affected. If you earn £50,000 and also give up 5% (£2,500), you will pay your normal national insurance rate of 8% on the £500 that's above the £2,000 limit. That amounts to an extra £40 a year out of your take-home pay. If you earn £60,000 and also sacrifice 5% of that (£3,000), you will pay 2% on the £1,000 that's above the £2,000 limit. So £20 - less than the person earning £50,000 a year. That's because the national insurance rate drops from 8% to 2% once you earn more than £50,270 - the higher-rate threshold. Someone earning £52,000 will pay more (£48) thanks to this change than someone earning £87,000 (£47), assuming they both contribute 5% to their pensions. That's because the person earning £52,000 will be regarded as paying the basic rate of tax, because they earn under the higher-rate threshold after \"sacrificing\" the 5% (£2,600) of their income. The overall tax bill of the higher earner will still be more, because of the normal rates of income tax and national insurance paid on the rest of your earnings. Read more:Salary sacrifice raid confirmed in Reeves's budget. Here's why experts are sounding the alarmCash ISA limit has been slashed - but some people are exempt Dan Neidle, a leading tax expert and head of Tax Policy Associates Ltd, told Sky News \"salary sacrifice was a smaller benefit to higher earners because of their lower marginal national insurance rate. So (partially) withdrawing that inevitably hits those same higher earners less.\" Higher earners pay more national insurance at the 2% \"over £50,270\" rate, compared with lower earners. Mr Neidle added that employer national insurance costs, not included in our calculator, represent 15% of taxable income, and that doesn't change across income levels. Employers are also impacted by this change, and may choose to pass costs on to their employees by offering less generous pension schemes in future. The employer contribution part of the policy is more lucrative to the treasury than the employee part. The OBR estimate that the change will generate £4.7bn of additional national insurance revenue in the 2029/30 tax year.

Luckily, our colleagues over in the Money Blog know their Air Passenger Duty from their ISA threshold limits, so have done the hard work for you. Following the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) accidentally releasing details of the budget almost an hour before Rachel Reeves stood up yesterday, the financial watchdog said it would start an investigation. We've now got a bit more on that. In a document published on their website, the OBR says the investigation will be carried out \"swiftly\" to provide answers to the chancellor, Treasury, and MPs by Monday 1 December - four days time. Any report will also be published, the organisation confirms. This is so the various groups can \"be informed of the facts of what\nhappened and the further actions that need to be taken in response at the earliest possible\nopportunity\". Here is the moment it happened, in case you missed it: The watchdog says that members of the independent oversight board, Baroness Sarah Hogg and Dame Susan Rice, will lead the investigation. They will be helped by Ciaran Martin, the former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, as well as IT experts in the Treasury. According to the document published by the OBR, the terms of reference will include: • Establish the events that made it possible to access the EFO early. • Determine the actions needed to assure the Oversight Board, the Chancellor, the Treasury and the Commons Treasury Committee that no future breaches of forecast security will take place. • Set a timeline for implementing those actions. • Make other recommendations to the OBR in light of its findings, as it sees fit. You can also watch the moment the head of the OBR, Richard Hughes, apologised and said he felt \"mortified\" by the incident. The prime minister, the chancellor and the energy secretary have been on a joint visit to a community centre in Rugby today. They have been chatting to people at the Benn Partnership Centre, where they've been talking up how the budget will help with the cost of living. The chancellor's budget, which she unveiled yesterday, raised taxes by more than £26bn, and even Rachel Reeves has admitted it means \"working people will pay more\". But the PM has denied it means Labour has breached their manifesto commitments. Speaking to Sky News, Sir Keir Starmer insisted that the chancellor \"kept to our manifesto\" - but refused to rule out more tax rises in the future. Among the cost-cutting measures include scrapping the two-child benefit cap, £150 off people's energy bills and freezing train fares in England, as well as the cost of prescriptions. The Tories have called on Reeves to resign - but she has insisted she is going nowhere. Have a look at some more photos from their visit below... What we saw during a visit in Rugby today was a rarity, an impassioned Sir Keir Starmer who really did want to \"take the argument on and argue about the choices he made at the heart\" of the budget, ourpolitical editor Beth Rigbysays. In his first interview with Sky News since the budget, Beth asked the PM whether he had misled the public by insisting a Labour government would not raise taxes on working people. Even the chancellor has openly admitted that her budget means \"working people will pay more\". But Starmer denied he had misled the public. \"This budget, the government has clearly made different choices for different reasons,\" Beth says. She adds: \"What I was trying to do in that interview was to try and get the prime minister to acknowledge that and explain it. \"But what he actually did was, he said, 'I haven't broken my manifesto promises', and he stuck with the line, really, that they have asked people to contribute more.\" Beth says she believes there is a \"question about accountability\" because she says, regardless of whether you agree with those decisions, there's a question about \"what they told voters in the run-up to the general election and beyond\". The PM was \"very clear\" 18 months ago that the government couldn't afford to lift the two-child benefit cap, and didn't put it in the manifesto. But, of course, all this has now changed. Beth also says the government is in a \"difficult position\" because Labour MPs really like this policy and Starmer gave an \"impassioned defence of why he had done that there\". But, she adds, \"the fact remains that he is raising taxes on those working people in the squeezed middle that he said he wouldn't\". Beth says he is doing this to carry out policies that \"please his party\" in order to \"buy some time and get some relief from the political pressure they're under\". But this change in direction also brought out a \"prime minister that's prepared to take on that fight, prepared to argue the case\". Summing up, she says: \"I do think there's an accountability question, but I also think the prime minister wanted to make the argument and put his shoulder to the wheel.\" By Hannah Woodward, political news editor Eluned Morgan's government in Wales has lost a vote in the Senedd over Rachel Reeves's budget. The Labour Welsh government lost a vote after opposition members combined forces to challenge the UK government's budget. The Conservative-led motion, endorsed by Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats, charged Sir Keir Starmer's government with \"failing the people of Wales\". Reeves's budget promised an extra £505m for Wales over the rest of the parliament, an end to the two-child benefit limit. But there was also a freeze in income tax thresholds - meaning more people in Wales will go into higher tax bands as their wages increase. The Welsh Conservatives said: \"Labour's claim that they wouldn't raise taxes on working people has been exposed for the second budget in a row.\" Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru warned that \"the Treasury continues to withhold over £4bn owed to Wales in transport funding\". Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth added: \"There was no action on increased national insurance or inheritance tax costs, which are pushing the Welsh public and private sectors to breaking point.\" Unlike her political opponents, the first minister welcomed Reeves's budget, saying it \"will mean more money in the pocket of people who need it the most, support for energy bills, a raise in the minimum wage and good news for pensioners\". The Tory motion passed narrowly, 25–24, marking the Welsh government's first defeat since Labour lost a seat to Plaid Cymru in the Caerphilly by‑election. Big challenges ahead for Welsh Labour With only 28 members, Labour now needs support from at least two opposition MS's to push decisions through. Although the vote on Reeves's budget was purely symbolic and carries no direct impact for Wales, it signals deeper challenges ahead for Morgan. One of the next big battles for her and Welsh Labour will be getting the Welsh government’s own budget passed, which is due in January. A huge vote is scheduled in Wales in the new year, when the Welsh government will present its spending plans for the next financial year. Should Labour's Senedd members fail to secure opposition support and reach an agreement, there would be automatic cuts. Opposition parties have made clear they hope to avoid that outcome. The Welsh government is currently holding talks with the Welsh Conservatives, the sole Welsh Liberal Democrat MS, and an Independent MS to secure support for the budget. So far, no agreements have been reached with any of these parties. Mike Tapp has welcomed new figures out today that show net migration to the UK has fallen to its lowest level since 2021. The migration minister said this is a \"positive sign we've dome down from that peak of around 944,000 under the last government\". Data from the Office for National Statistics shows net migration is 204,000 in the year to June. Tapp said: \"It's about bringing back that order, that control and ensuring that legal migration isn't an open door, which is what we saw in the last government, so that British workers aren't being undercut. \"But we've still got a long way to go, both on legal and illegal migration.\" Tapp was asked if the Tories should be given some credit for this, given they introduced a number of measures to deter legal migration before the 2024 election. Former home secretary James Cleverly has taken responsibility for the figures, saying they are \"down because of the visa regime that I put in place\". But the minister insists that \"this is a Labour government, it has been for the last 18 months\". He added: \"It was the Conservatives that gave us open borders on illegal migration, 400 crossed in 2018 that then led to over 150,000 coming in on boats. And then when it comes to legal migration, nearly a million in a year, undercutting British workers because a lot of that was low skilled labour. \"So, we do not thank the Conservatives for that and we'll continue down this path to bring migration down.\" Reform UK has hit out at the government for the \"largest exodus of people since the 1920s\". The party, more widely known for criticising the number of people coming into the UK, have been responding to new figures that show net migration has fallen to a four-year low, and reduced by 69% over the last year. For context: Net migration is the total number of people who have moved to the UK (immigration), minus the total number of people who have left the UK for other countries (emigration). It has been falling for two years, and both the Tories and Labour have claimed credit. But responding to the news, the party's head of policy, Zia Yusuf, said: \"There is no better example of Labour’s warped priorities than today's migration figures. \"693,000 people left the UK in the year to June, mainly caused by the largest exodus of people since the 1920s. That number is likely to increase further following the disastrous budget yesterday.\" Yusuf also hit out at separate figures, also released this morning, showing that the number of asylum seekers housed in hotels has increased - despite a government pledge to end their use altogether. Yusuf said: \"The number of people housed in migrant hotels has grown a staggering 23 per cent since the election and there was a record number of asylum claims last year. \"Reform is the only party that wants to secure our borders, bring an end to mass immigration and deport those here illegally.\" Net migration has fallen, but new data out today shows that the government \"still needs to get a grip on small boat arrivals\", the Liberal Democrats have warned. Figures from the ONS show net migration has fallen to its lowest level in four years. But data also reveals that small boat arrivals were up 53% in the year to September 2025, compared to the previous 12 months. It also showed a 13% rise in the number of asylum seekers staying in hotels in September, compared to June. This is despite the government pledging to completely end the use of these by 2029. Max Wilkinson, the party's home affairs spokesperson, said: \" These figures show that the government still needs to get a grip on small boat arrivals and the use of asylum hotels. \"The OBR has warned that, without action, taxpayers face more than £1bn of extra pressure on the Home Office budget before the end of this parliament. \"The government promised to end hotel use and reduce spending - yet still has no credible plan to do so. \"The Liberal Democrats have set out a clear plan to cut the backlog and end hotel use within six months, using Nightingale-style processing centres. \"We would also lift the ban on asylum seekers working so they can support themselves, integrate and pay taxes.\" Downing Street has rejected predictions by the OBR that rolling out the government's digital ID scheme will cost £1.8bn over three years. In September, Sir Keir Starmer formally announced that anybody who wishes to work in the UK will require a form of government-issued digital ID. In practice, that means that almost every adult in the UK will need a form of digital ID. The PM also said this would be in place by 2029. In its analysis of the chancellor's budget, the OBR has concluded that the scheme will cost almost £2bn - across three years. But Downing Street has rejected this suggestion. A spokesperson for Number 10 said: \"The number in OBR forecast was an initial early assessment spread over a number of years. \"We do not recognise it as accurate as the programme, the scope of which is yet to be decided, let alone costed. \"Any costs in the review period will be met within existing settlements. The government will run a full consultation in due course.\" Now the dust has settled in the budget, what happens now - watch this video here to find out: Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has defended the budget's gambling tax hike in the Commons, saying the government sought to limit the economic impact. Nandy said she had worked closely with the Chancellor to \"ensure that the measures that she announced yesterday protect people who gathered great joy from an industry that is worth huge amounts to the UK economy\". The measures, which will fund the removal of the two-child benefit cap, were \"not a signal\" to the sector but a necessary choice to make a \"significant dent\" in child poverty, Nandy said. The chancellor had announced a raise of taxes on online gaming and betting, in a move set to raise £1.1 billion by 2029. This includes a rise of the remote gaming duty applying to online games from 21% to 40% next year. Taxes on online sports betting – excluding horseracing – will increase from 15% to 25% from April 2027. Nandy said the government was still seeking to shield high street businesses, such as bingo halls and pubs, and had lowered business rates for retail and hospitality properties to that effect.  ",

    "content": "Researchers found that a quarter of those with the least flexible arteries were 2.5 times more likely to develop heart failure compared to those with the most flexible arteries. Thursday 27 November 2025 08:20, UK A simple ultrasound scan of blood vessels in the neck could help detect men at increased risk of heart attack and stroke. British researchers said they believe GPs could consider scanning the carotid arteries of patients over 60. These large arteries supply blood to the brain, face and neck and are usually elastic. But scientists said they can stiffen with certain diseases and age, leading to high blood pressure, heart failure and an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. The scan is similar to ultrasounds offered during pregnancy and uses a small handheld device that is moved gently over the neck. The results reveal the flexibility of the carotid arteries, which run up either side of the neck, and how much they stretch and expand with each heartbeat. The study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, was led by University College London (UCL) and included 1,631 men aged 71 to 92. It found that a quarter of those with the least flexible arteries were 2.5 times more likely to develop heart failure compared to those with the most flexible arteries. Politics latest: Starmer challenged over 'misleading the public' with budget tax rises Budget 2025: The town where voters placed trust in Labour - and some now feel betrayed Holidays blow with budget announcement most of us missed | Money blog Dr Atinuke Akinmolayan, who led the research from UCL and is now a GP, said: \"The carotid ultrasound is a safe, cheap and painless investigation, and our findings suggest it may be able to provide an early warning sign for heart failure. \"More research is needed, especially to see if this works for women, but this is something GPs could look at offering to people over the age of 60, where possible and believed needed.\" Read more from Sky News:Warning over ultra-processed foodsPioneering heart surgeon diesRise in high blood pressure among children Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News The research was part-funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research along with the British Heart Foundation (BHF), which estimates that around 920,000 people in the UK are living with heart failure. Professor Bryan Williams, chief scientific and medical officer at the BHF, said: \"The findings of this study are interesting and show that stiffening of arteries is associated with increased risk of heart failure, most likely due to the heart having to work harder against the resistance caused by these stiffer arteries.\" The research suggests that for every 0.16 millimetre increase in the thickness of men's vessels, heart attack risk increased by about 29%. Typically, people only receive this type of scan if they have suffered a stroke or are at risk of one. Be the first to getBreaking News Install the Sky News app for free Researchers said a scan can identify a build-up of fatty material which can cause a stroke by breaking off and travelling into the brain or by narrowing the arteries and stopping blood reaching the brain. Experts also said that when the carotid arteries become less flexible, they do not expand properly to let blood through, which can raise blood pressure and can eventually lead to heart failure.",

Home affairs reporter and feature writer@Henry_Vaughan Wednesday 26 November 2025 17:39, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  A former Royal Marine wept in court as he admitted driving into crowds at Liverpool's Premier League victory parade. Paul Doyle, 54, was due to go on trial at Liverpool Crown Court over theincident on 26 May, when more than a million fans were gathered in the city centre to celebrate the football team's 20th title win. He hadpreviously denied31 charges, but sobbed in the dock, with his voice, at times, barely audible, as he dramaticallychanged his pleasto guilty. Doyle admitted dangerous driving, affray, 17 charges of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent, nine counts of causing GBH with intent and three counts of wounding with intent. Recorder of Liverpool Judge Andrew Menary KC remanded Doyle in custody ahead of a two-day sentencing hearing from 15 December, telling him a long prison sentence is \"inevitable\". Doyle, a married father-of-three, hit more than 100 people in just seven minutes with his Ford Galaxy Titanium at around 6pm as crowds made their way home from the open-top bus parade. The charges relate to 29 victims, aged between six months and 77 years old, including eight who were children at the time. The parents of the youngest victim, Teddy Eveson, later told media he was thrown about 15 feet down the road in his pram when the crash happened. Another victim Rob Darke, who was left with a \"life-changing\" injury after attending the parade with his two sons, told Sky News he thought it was a terrorist attack. \"There was people lying about all over the place. It was like a bomb had gone off... it was carnage everywhere... people crying and screaming,\" he said. \"I thought it was terrorists. That's the first thing that came into my head. Who else would do a thing like that?\" 'Turned celebration to mayhem' Prosecutors said dashcam footage from Doyle's car showed he became \"increasingly agitated by the crowds\" as he approached Dale Street and Water Street. \"Rather than wait for them to pass, he deliberately drove at them, forcing his way through,\" said Sarah Hammond, chief crown prosecutor for CPS Mersey-Cheshire. \"Driving a vehicle into a crowd is an act of calculated violence. This was not a momentary lapse by Paul Doyle - it was a choice he made that day and it turned celebration into mayhem.\" Read more from Sky News:Main announcements in the budget at a glanceRussia contradicts Trump on Ukraine peace talksTokyo overtaken as world's biggest city  Keep up with all the latest news from the UK and around the world by following Sky News Be the first to getBreaking News Install the Sky News app for free Detective Chief Inspector John Fitzgerald, of Merseyside Police, said: \"It is only by sheer luck that nobody was killed because of Doyle's reckless actions. \"In just seven minutes his dangerous driving meant that his car collided with more than 100 people, including children, in some cases trapping people underneath and causing serious injuries.\" A Liverpool FC spokesman said: \"Our victory parade last May allowed an unprecedented number of Liverpool fans to celebrate together our Premier League title win - something we were unable to do in 2020. \"The day of incredible joy ended in unimaginable circumstances and we hope today's conviction brings some peace to all those affected by the horrific incident.

Yusuf said: \"The number of people housed in migrant hotels has grown a staggering 23 per cent since the election and there was a record number of asylum claims last year. \"Reform is the only party that wants to secure our borders, bring an end to mass immigration and deport those here illegally.\" Net migration has fallen, but new data out today shows that the government \"still needs to get a grip on small boat arrivals\", the Liberal Democrats have warned. Figures from the ONS show net migration has fallen to its lowest level in four years. But data also reveals that small boat arrivals were up 53% in the year to September 2025, compared to the previous 12 months. It also showed a 13% rise in the number of asylum seekers staying in hotels in September, compared to June. This is despite the government pledging to completely end the use of these by 2029. Max Wilkinson, the party's home affairs spokesperson, said: \" These figures show that the government still needs to get a grip on small boat arrivals and the use of asylum hotels. \"The OBR has warned that, without action, taxpayers face more than £1bn of extra pressure on the Home Office budget before the end of this parliament. \"The government promised to end hotel use and reduce spending - yet still has no credible plan to do so. \"The Liberal Democrats have set out a clear plan to cut the backlog and end hotel use within six months, using Nightingale-style processing centres. \"We would also lift the ban on asylum seekers working so they can support themselves, integrate and pay taxes.\" Downing Street has rejected predictions by the OBR that rolling out the government's digital ID scheme will cost £1.8bn over three years. In September, Sir Keir Starmer formally announced that anybody who wishes to work in the UK will require a form of government-issued digital ID. In practice, that means that almost every adult in the UK will need a form of digital ID. The PM also said this would be in place by 2029. In its analysis of the chancellor's budget, the OBR has concluded that the scheme will cost almost £2bn - across three years. But Downing Street has rejected this suggestion. A spokesperson for Number 10 said: \"The number in OBR forecast was an initial early assessment spread over a number of years. \"We do not recognise it as accurate as the programme, the scope of which is yet to be decided, let alone costed. \"Any costs in the review period will be met within existing settlements. The government will run a full consultation in due course.\" Now the dust has settled in the budget, what happens now - watch this video here to find out: Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy has defended the budget's gambling tax hike in the Commons, saying the government sought to limit the economic impact. Nandy said she had worked closely with the Chancellor to \"ensure that the measures that she announced yesterday protect people who gathered great joy from an industry that is worth huge amounts to the UK economy\". The measures, which will fund the removal of the two-child benefit cap, were \"not a signal\" to the sector but a necessary choice to make a \"significant dent\" in child poverty, Nandy said. The chancellor had announced a raise of taxes on online gaming and betting, in a move set to raise £1.1 billion by 2029. This includes a rise of the remote gaming duty applying to online games from 21% to 40% next year. Taxes on online sports betting – excluding horseracing – will increase from 15% to 25% from April 2027. Nandy said the government was still seeking to shield high street businesses, such as bingo halls and pubs, and had lowered business rates for retail and hospitality properties to that effect.  ",

Thursday 27 November 2025 12:03, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player  Sir Keir Starmer has insisted Labour \"kept to our manifesto\" promises despite raising taxes in the budget - as he asked \"everybody to contribute\". The morning after the chancellor announced her record-breaking tax-raising budget, the prime minister told Sky News political editorBeth Rigbythe government had \"done the least possible we can\" to impact people and had \"done it in a fair way\". He said it was \"not true\" his government has misled the public after promising not to raise taxes again after last year's budget. And he refused multiple times to say he had broken his manifesto promise not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT \"on working people\". \"We kept to our manifesto in terms of what we've promised,\" he said. \"But I accept the challenge that we've asked everybody to contribute. I want to be really clear on why we've done that,\" Sir Keir continued. \"That is because we need to protect our NHS, to make sure that it's there for people when they need it and their families when they need it.

But put to him that this was \"to save your own skin\", Sir Keir refuted that, saying he has always been \"determined to drive down child poverty\". Sir Keir added that \"we've done a lot to stabilise the economy\", which he said was shown by the £21.7bn headroom the tax rises have given the economy and the market reaction to the budget. \"So, it's clear that others think the right measures have been put in place,\" he said.

She confirmed 43 tax increases to raise an extra £26bn, bringing taxes to an all-time high. One of the largest tax hikes was the extension to the freeze in income tax thresholds by three years until 2031 to raise £8.3bn more by the end of the decade. But Ms Reeves also insisted this was not a betrayal of Labour's manifesto promise. She admitted to Sky News political editor Beth Rigby she is \"asking ordinary people to pay a little bit more\" but said the manifesto promise was \"very specific\".

    "content": "Dr Rahmeh Aladwan is being investigated over social media posts and comments and allegedly described the Royal Free Hospital as a \"Jewish supremacy cesspit\". She denies making racist or hate speech. Thursday 27 November 2025 12:39, UK A London-based Palestinian doctor accused of antisemitism has had her UK registration suspended for 15 months. Dr Rahmeh Aladwan is being investigated by the General Medical Council (GMC) over a series of posts and comments across various social media platforms, a tribunal heard this week. This had followed a number of complaints, including from the Jewish Medical Association UK and the Campaign Against Antisemitism. On Wednesday, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service (MPTS) imposed a 15-month interim suspension on her registration, with a review every six months. GMC counsel Emma Gilsenan told the tribunal that Dr Aladwan's posts allegedly included content that \"justifies terrorism, denies sexual violence, includes antisemitic conspiracy theories, misuses Holocaust and Nazi imagery and expresses support for proscribed groups and terrorist acts\". Dr Aladwan allegedly referred to the Royal Free Hospital inLondonas a \"Jewish supremacy cesspit\", Ms Gilsenan added. She also alleged Dr Aladwan had doxxed - published identfying information about - colleagues who raised concerns about her and expressed explicit support for Hamas and Palestine Action, which wasadded to the list of proscribed terror groups earlier this year. Ms Gilsenan said it was \"unconscionable to consider that Dr Aladwan should be permitted to continue to practise\". Dr Aladwan's lawyer, Kevin Saunders, submitted that the posts \"fell into the category of legitimate political speech and debate\". He added that she denies making racist or hate speech, and that there was \"no information to suggest Dr Aladwan presents a real and immediate risk to patient safety\". Read more:Palestine Action activist accused of sledgehammer attackStarmer orders mandatory antisemitism training for NHS staff Dr Aladwan was arrested last month on suspicion of misusing a public communications network, sending malicious communications and stirring up racial hatred. The investigation by theMetropolitan Policerelates to allegations that comments made at a July protest in London, and online in recent months, were \"grossly offensive and antisemitic\". The MPTS had ruled in September it would not impose interim conditions on Dr Aladwan's registration because it did not believe complaints against her were \"sufficient to establish that there may be a real risk to patients\". 'Patients may be discouraged from seeking treatment from her' But on Wednesday, the tribunal's chair, Lee Davies, found the alleged conduct \"may impact on patient confidence in both her and the profession and patients may be discouraged from seeking treatment from her\". He added that \"additional information\" had been made available since September which may \"may indicate an escalation in the tone and nature of Dr Aladwan's activities and posts which may be considered to be extreme, offensive and antisemitic\". Be the first to getBreaking News Install the Sky News app for free Follow our channel and never miss an update Mr Davies said: \"The tribunal considers that the allegations, if found proved, are serious and appear to have arisen from persistent and prolonged posting of potentially egregious material which has been widely disseminated by Dr Aladwan, resulting in a number of individual complaints made to the GMC. \"While the tribunal is mindful of Dr Aladwan's freedom of expression rights, it has noted a number of comments which allegedly support and celebrate terrorist acts and organisations, and promote violent action and offensive Jewish tropes.\"",

    "title": "How the EU seeks to counter China in Africa – DW – 11/25/2025",
    "content": "European and African leaders held talks in Angola on raw materials, security and the Global Gateway initiative. How can the EU compete with China on the continent? Maria Magdalena and her four children live in a wooden hut in a small settlement on the sandy soil of the Ilha do Cabo peninsula inAngola. From here, she can see cargo ships waiting in endless lines to enter the harbor in the country's capital, Luanda. Angola is rich in raw materials, but the vast majority of the population lives in poverty. Magdalena also has a view of the city's skyline but is not following the key summit in the capital's government district on the other side of the bay. It is hard enough for her to organize her daily life. \"I urgently need work. Without work, I cannot feed my children,\" she said. In Luanda, theAfrican Union(AU) and theEuropean Union(EU) held their seventh summit under the theme \"promoting peace and prosperity through effective multilateralism.\" Together, they represent 82 countries with a population of almost 2 billion people. Pressure has never been this high. \"As we all know, uncertainty prevails on the international stage. The established norms of international geopolitics are being challenged,\" Mahmoud Youssouf, the chair of the AU Commission, said ahead of the conference in astatement. Russia is fighting a warin Europe, US PresidentDonald Trumplevies radical tariffs and breaks the rules of theWorld Trade Organization.Chinapushes aggressively into global markets. Conflicts in Africa are intensifying: a brutal war rages inSudan, and jihadist extremism spreads across theSahel region. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video In addition, parts of Africa suffer greatly fromclimate change. \"Droughts destroy livelihoods. It's a dangerous mix. And people take dangerous routes across the Atlantic and the Mediterranean,\" German ChancellorFriedrich Merzstated at the summit. Before rushing to the conference hall, Merz attended an informal last-minute meeting of EU leaders. Even in Luanda,there are discussionson how to proceed in Russia's war against Ukraine. For Merz and the other heads of state and government, this amounts to politics in crisis mode, while Africa and Europe seek to close ranks. In the summit's final declaration, they insist on a world order \"based on international law and effective multilateralism.\" TheEuropean Unionis Africa's largest trading partner and investor. According toEuropean CommissionPresidentUrsula von der Leyen,one-third of all African exports go to Europe. Many African countries have critical raw materialsthat Europe needs for its energy transition and industry:rare earths, copper, cobalt and lithium. However, there is much competition, and Africa wants to avoid unilateral dependencies. \"The world does not consist of just one or two countries. We work with everyone who is open to us,\" said Angola's President Joao Lourenco, the current chair of the AU. \"We are open to the world.\" \"We don't want to leave the continent to others,\" warned Merz, referring to China primarily. Through itsBelt and Road Initiative, China has been investing in Africa's bridges, ports and roads. Even the brand-new airport in Luanda was built and financed by China as a prestige project. \"China helped rebuild Angola after the civil war in 2002 with loans and infrastructure projects,\" Vandre Spellmeier of the delegation of the German Industry and Commerce in Angola (AHK Angola), told DW. In his view, it is \"not too late for the European Union.\" Angola is now trying to free itself from the crushing debt it owes China. \"This future African and European cooperation should emphasize the exchange of knowledge and skills that contribute to transforming African local economies,\" Hermine Sam, Program Coordinator South at the German Marshall Fund, told DW. Otherwise, the old spiral remains, she said. \"Raw materials leave cheaply and return expensively processed.\" Olaf Wientzek, head of the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation's multinational development dialogue in Brussels, also sees this as leverage. \"Strengthening local processing capacities, that's where Europe can score points against China,\" he told DW. European procedures are often stricter and slower, he admits. \"But Europe wants to give the economy more participation than China.\" The Global Gateway Initiative is often viewed as the EU's response to China. The investment program supports infrastructure projects with EU financing and private investors. One of Global Gateway's prestigious projects is being built in Angola: the Lobito Corridor, a railway line connecting the raw-material regions of Angola, theDemocratic Republic of CongoandZambiawith the Atlantic coast. Businesses are to be established along the route, ranging fromagricultureto logistics. The EU is proud of this showcase project. \"While we connect Africa to global markets, we are also supportingtrade within your continent. I think this is the best way for African companies to scale up and prepare for global competition,\" von der Leyen said. Germany's Merz supported her statement. \"The European single market is a great success story and the largest peace project Europe has ever seen. And it is precisely against this backdrop that Germany has supported the Pan-African Free Trade Area from the outset,\" he said. Yet there is considerable criticism. \"In its conception, Global Gateway was not developed in consultation with African stakeholders and overlooked African priorities,\" Hermine Sam told DW. She said the EU is frequently criticized for \"making big speeches but delivering little, especially compared to China.\" Africa is a particularly young continent: 40% of its population is under 15 years old. They need education, jobs, and housing. This is in stark contrast to Europe, where only 16% are under 15. \"The young African generation, which is creative, dynamic, and rapidly growing, is one of the greatest assets for our shared future,\" European Council President Antonio Costa stated. But what remains after two days of the EU-AU summit in Luanda, which the government declared a public holiday in view of the many international guests? Magdalena, the mother of four, says she avoids politics. She is frying food on a small charcoal fire. She, too, has hopes for the future. \"I'm young. I really need work urgently.\" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video This article was originally written in German.",

    "title": "US pushes Latin America trade as EU-Mercosur deal stalls – DW – 11/26/2025",
    "content": "The Trump administration is rushing to finalize new trade agreements with Latin American countries, increasing pressure on the European Union as it attempts to finalize its own Mercosur deal. Brazil's PresidentLuiz Inacio Lula da Silvainsisted this week that there are no remaining obstacles to signing theEU-Mercosurtrade agreement next month after more than two decades of negotiations. Speaking on the sidelines of theG20summit in South Africa, Lula said the deal would represent \"possibly the largest agreement\" in global trade, citing both blocs' nearly 722 million population and $22 trillion in gross domestic product (GDP). But while EU trade representatives consider the Mercosur pact to be a done deal,France and Hungary are calling for last-minute changes, citing risks to theiragricultural sectors. And while the long-sought pact remains precarious,the US is stepping up efforts to sign trade dealsof their own with several countries in the region. In recent weeks, the White House has announced or negotiated framework agreements withArgentina,Guatemala,El SalvadorandEcuador, as part of the Trump administration's push to shift trade balances and curb China's growing influence. \"On a geopolitical level, these agreements strengthen the US presence amid growing competition with China in infrastructure, technology and critical minerals,\" Vladimir Rouvinski, a political scientist at ICESI University in Cali, Colombia, told DW. Rouvinski said closer trade ties with the US would give Latin American countries \"greater room to maneuver, access to technical collaboration and opportunities to diversify production.\" He believes the deals could anchor Latin America within the US's shifting economic priorities and give the region a stronger footing in the broader global realignment. In the race for geopolitical influence in Latin America,Chinais currentlyoutpacing rivals from the US and the EU, according to arecent reportby the German foreign trade and investment agency (GTAI). In Argentina, for example, China recently replaced Brazil as the country's biggest trading partner, with Chinese imports of Argentine goods — especially soybeans and beef — rising sharply, while Argentina’s imports from China also expanded. Over the same period, the US slipped to fourth place, behind Brazil and the European Union, helping explain Washington's renewed interest in closer ties with Buenos Aires. Moreover, Latin America's exports to China rose 7% overall, driven largely by higher shipments of meat and soybeans and rising copper prices, according to the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC). According toECLAC's latest annual reporton international trade, most countries in Latin America and the Caribbean face lowertariffsin their US trade than several of Washington's main trading partners, particularly from Asia. \"This situation creates opportunities for trade diversion in favor of the region's exports, in sectors such as clothing, medical devices and agro-industry,\" the ECLAC wrote. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Diana Luna of the liberal-leaning Friedrich Ebert Foundation in Germany told DW that the Trump administration is resorting to a familiar approach, notably \"the classic 'carrot and stick' method\" to bolster its trade position in Latin America. Countries perceived as cooperative on migration and security — such as Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador — or politically aligned states like Argentina are being given favorable treatment, Luna said, adding that new deals reinforce these countries as strategic partners and signal a pushback against China. \"In Argentina, they [agreements] represent the first concrete step following the Trump administration's financial engagement. They encourage investment, especially in the pharmaceutical sector, and send a clear message to the markets: Argentina is worth investing in — an important signal for leaders like [Argentinian President Javier] Milei, who rely on foreign capital to spur growth.\" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video However, Argentina's libertarian leaderJavier Mileimust now tread a narrow path. The new US trade frameworks may not be fully compatible with Mercosur rules, raising the possibility that the country might have to choose between the US approach and its Mercosur commitments. Such a choice could have \"significant repercussions for Brazil and trade across the [Mercosur] bloc,\" Luna warned. Marcela Franzoni, an international relations expert at Ibmec University in Rio de Janeiro, agreed, telling Brazil's leading economic daily,Valor, recently, that one immediate effect could be the erosion of Brazil's market share in Argentina, as lower-cost US goods gain access. Europe, meanwhile, remains stuck waiting in the wings — partly of its own making, said Luna, adding that EU negotiators still have \"extensive lists of demands,\" while bilateral US deals offer \"quicker and more tangible results.\" This article was originally written in German.",

    "content": "The European Space Agency announced plans for a German astronaut to participate in the moon mission. Meanwhile, Turkish authorities confirmed that a German family died in Istanbul from chemical poisoning. DW has more. Below, you can review a roundup of news fromGermanyon 25th November, 2025: Former German ChancellorAngela Merkelcalled reports that she partially blamed Poland and the Baltic states for Russia's war on Ukraine \"fake news.\" Speaking to German public broadcaster Phoenix, the former German chancellor said a passage from her autobiography was taken out of context. Merkel explained that while those countries opposed her proposed dialogue with Moscow in 2021, this was never about assigning blame. \"None of us, everyone, me, everyone else, was able to prevent this war,\" Merkel said. She stressedthe war in Ukraineis Russia's aggression under President Vladimir Putin. \"This war broke out, it has changed our world, it is an aggression by the Russian Federation, the Russian Republic, [Russian President]Vladimir Putin,\" Merkel said. She also dismissed claims the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine would not have happened if she were still in office, calling them \"speculative.\" A Ukrainian under suspicion of coordinating the attack on the Nord Stream pipeline has beenextradited from Italy to Germany on Thursday, judicial sources told the German dpa news agency. The 2022 attack targeted the pipeline bringing Russian gas directly to Germany through the Baltic Sea. Both Moscow and the West described it as an act of sabotage. The suspect, identified under German privacy laws only as Serhii K., was arrested in Italy's Rimini in August on a European warrant. The charges against him include collusion to cause an explosion, anti-constitutional sabotage and destruction of important structures. His lawyer Nicola Canestrini has said he is confident of an acquittal following a trial in Germany, despite having fought extradition. Another suspect, identified by German authorities as Volodymyr Z., was arrested in Poland in September. A Polish court ruled last month against his extradition.

This was announced by the head of the European Space Agency (ESA), Josef Aschbacher, on the sidelines of the ESA Ministerial Council meeting in Bremen. \"I have decided that the first Europeans to fly to the moon will be part of the Artemis program. We are looking for a German astronaut to join the crew,\" he said. While it's not known who would make it to the moon, two candidates could be considered, German ESA astronauts Alexander Gerst (49) and Matthias Maurer (55). It could still be years before the mission takes place, if at all. The US is looking to send astronauts back to the moon with the Artemis program with four US astronauts scheduled to orbit the moon in the first half of 2026. In 2027, Artemis 3 is expected to see astronauts land on the moon again after more than half a century. A man who poured petrol on his wife before setting her alight on a tram in the eastern German city of Gera has been sentenced to life imprisonment. The Georgian national was found guilty of attempted murder and aggravated assault. He was ordered to pay €75,000 ($87,000) in compensation. Judge Uwe Tonndorf said the man tried to kill his wife because she wanted to end their marriage. She suffered life-threatening injuries as a result of the attack. \"You have destroyed your family and your own life at the same time,\" Tonndorf said. The convicted man immigrated to Germany in 2018, and his wife and children later followed. The man knew that other passengers could be injured in the March attack, so he fled before attempting to take his own life. He later surrendered to the police.

The coalition, comprised ofChancellor Friedrich Merz'sconservative CDU/CSU bloc and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), was formed following a general election in February that was triggered by the collapse of the previous government. Of those polled, 29% said they believed the coalition government would last, while 11% of respondents provided no answer. The majority of supporters of Merz's conservative bloc (56%) believed the coalition would last. INSA said its survey involved interviewing over 1,000 eligible voters between November 21 and 24. The survey comes amid an atmosphere of tension inside the coalition over planned pension reforms. The proposal for Germany's pension system, which is facing the challenges inherent in an aging society, have come under criticism even from within Merz's conservative bloc. At the heart of the issue is an agreement by conservatives and the center-left to prop up pensions until 2031 at the current level of 48% of the income of an average earner. The CDU/CSU's youth organizationhas called on young conservative lawmakers not to approve the pension packagein its current form, arguing that it is too expensive and puts an undue burden on younger workers and future generations. Authorities inTurkeyconfirmed that the death of a German family in Istanbul while on vacation was result of chemical poisoning. Turkish prosecutors said a forensic report established that the cause of death of the family of four was insecticide used for pest control. The German family with Turkish roots had been staying ina hotel in Istanbul's Fatih districtwhen on November 12, they fell ill. They initially went to the hospital and then returned to the hotel. The following day, they were taken to the hospital by ambulance with both children, aged six and three, dying that day. Their mother died on November 14, while their father died on November 17. Food poisoning had initially been suspected and a number of street food vendors were detained. An autopsy, however, later confirmed the family members died of other causes. Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency previously cited a preliminary report submitted to the prosecutor's office saying phosphine gas, an insecticide metabolite, was found on towels, masks and swab samples taken from various parts of the hotel room. Six people who were arrested during the investigation, including the hotel owner and the owner of the pest control company, remain incustody. Guten Tagfrom the newsroom here in Bonn! Today, there is news out of Turkey confirming the cause of death of a German-Turkish family who died while visiting Istanbul earlier this month. Authorities have been in a race to establish the cause of death with food poisoning initially suspected. There is also a survey of Germans who feel Chancellor Friedrich Merz's coalition government won't make it to the end of its term in 2029 as scheduled.

    "title": "Ukraine updates: US delegation expected in Russia next week – DW – 11/27/2025",
    "content": "A United States delegation is due in Russia next week for talks on the war in Ukraine, according to Vladimir Putin, who has demanded the withdrawal of Ukrainian troops from territories claimed by Moscow. DW has more. Read on for the latest news, background and analysis related toRussia's war in Ukraineon Thursday, November 27: Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas said it would be \"senseless\" to sign any ceasefire deal with what he considers to be an \"illegitimate\" Ukrainian leadership. \"I hope that we can come to an agreement withUkrainein the future,\" he said—but claimed PresidentVolodymyr Zelenskyyand his democratically elected government lost legitimacy after their term expired. Ukraine says its constitution prevents it from holding elections while the country is under martial law and still defending itself against aforeign invasion. Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas made the withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from territories claimed byMoscowa precondition for any ceasefire. \"If Ukrainian forces leave the territories they hold, then we will stop combat operations,\" Putin said during a visit toKyrgyzstan. \"If they don't, then we will achieve it by military means.\" After illegally annexingCrimeain 2014,Russiaunilaterally claimed the annexation of the Ukrainian regions of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia in September 2022, despite controlling none of them entirely at the time. On Thursday, Putin said that \"Crimea and the Donbas should be the topic of our talks with theUnited States\"—the latter being generally understood to refer toLuhanskandDonetskregions together. Ukraine remains unwilling to cede territory which it still controls, especially the string of fortified cities in Donetsk including Sloviansk, Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk, which it continues to defend. Russian PresidentVladimir Putinhas confirmed that a United States delegation will arrive inRussianext week for talks onMoscow's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at the end of a visit to Bishkek, the capital ofKyrgyzstan, Putin said the Russian side would be represented by officials from the foreign ministry and presidential office, naming his advisors Vladimir Medinsky and Yuri Ushakov. According to Kremlin officials, US special envoy Steve Witkoff, who was involved in drawing up a controversial 28-point plan to end the war in Ukraine last week, is also expected in Moscow. \"In general, we agree that this can be the basis for future agreements,\" Putin said of the plan, adding that the variant of the plan discussed by theUnited StatesandUkrainein Switzerland recently had also been passed to Russia. A Ukrainian under suspicion of coordinating the attack on theNord Stream pipelinehas beenextradited from Italyto Germany on Thursday, judicial sources told the German dpa news agency. The 2022 attack targeted the pipeline bringing Russian gas directly to Germany through the Baltic Sea. Both Moscow and the West described it as an act of sabotage. The suspect, identified under German privacy laws only as Serhii K., was arrested in Italy's Rimini in August on a European warrant. The charges against him include collusion to cause an explosion, anti-constitutional sabotage and destruction of important structures. His lawyer Nicola Canestrini has said he is confident of an acquittal following a trial in Germany, despite having fought extradition. Another suspect, identified by German authorities as Volodymyr Z., was arrested in Poland in September. A Polish court ruled last monthagainst his extradition.

On October 8, 2022, a truck exploded on the bridge, setting fire to seven oil tankers on a freight train. Five people were killed in the explosion. Russiaannexed Crimea in 2014and later used as a launchpad for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine's secret service claimed responsibilityfor the attackthat temporarily shut down the key lifeline for the illegally occupied peninsula. Kerch bridge has been seen by both sides as a symbol of Russia's illegal annexation, withRussian President Vladimir Putinhimself inaugurating the 19-kilometer (12-mile) road and rail bridge in 2018. Ukraine has targeted the key bridge in several further attacks in the years since. Euroclear, a Belgian securities depository, has said that an EU plan to make use of frozen Russian assets could spook the market and raise borrowing costs, theFinancial Timesreported. Around €185 billion ($215 billion) of Russian assets are being held in the depository, with another €25 billion held in other EU countries, mostly in France and Luxembourg. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyensaid on Wednesday the EU was planning to introduce a legal text that could pave the way for the frozen assets to be used as a loan to fund Ukraine. Such a plan has been discussed since early in the war, but has been blocked byBelgium, fearing reprisals from Russia. Euroclear reportedly warned that the move could be seen as \"confiscation,\" damaging the EU's investment climate. German ChancellorFriedrich Merzis set to host hisEstonianPrime Minister Kristen Michal in Berlin. Following a ceremony with military honors, the two leaders are set to discuss security alongNATO'seastern flank, a topic that has been given increased importance following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Estonia shares a 300-kilometer (186-mile) border with Russia and has reported the presence of Russian drones or military jets in its airspace multiple times in the past week. Estonia, which like Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, has been one of Kyiv's most consistent supporters since the Russian invasion.

Nevertheless, the EU has expressed skepticism that Russia is ready to negotiate a peace and hascalled for increased pressureto bring it to the table.",

    "title": "Jakarta topples Tokyo as world's biggest city – DW – 11/23/2025",
    "content": "The view from Jakarta's tallest building — the Autograph Tower in the Thamrin Nine complex — is breathtaking. According to a new UN report, Jakarta is now the world's most populous megacity, with nearly 42 million inhabitants. While this rapid growth has brought economic opportunities, it has also put a strain on infrastructure, the environment and quality of life. In Jakarta, luxury residential complexes and glass office towers are often located just a few meters away from informal settlements. According to a study, the population density in Jakarta is now 22,000 people per square kilometer. As a result, social contrasts are particularly evident. While some live in modern high-rise buildings, many others struggle to find affordable housing. The growing population is also having an impact on urban traffic. Congested roads and traffic jams are commonplace, degrading air quality. According to a recent study by the Republic of Indonesia Defense University, particulate matter pollution is critical in densely populated areas such as central Jakarta. When it comes to green spaces, Jakarta has a lot of room for improvement. Although there are some local gardening projects, these aren't nearly enough. According to AI-powered satellite monitoring by Husqvarna Urban Green Space Insights (HUGSI), which monitors green spaces and their development, green spaces account for only 18% of Jakarta's total area. Of this, 14% is covered by trees. Immigration accounts for the largest share of the high population density. The birth rate in Jakarta is comparatively low, and the mortality rate is not above average. However, it's not only people moving to Jakarta, but also parts of the population moving to suburban areas favored by highly qualified people. The Indonesian capital isn't just struggling with overpopulation, but is also suffering the consequences of climate change. Many people living in the densely populated coastal areas must deal with regular flooding, or live in floating houses. The combination of sinking land due to excessive groundwater extraction, rising sea levels and heavier rainfall has put Jakarta particularly at risk. Indonesia's would-be new capital Nusantara, on the island of Borneo, is intended to take the pressure off Jakarta. The plan is to build a completely new \"smart forest city\" with plenty of green space, a sustainable energy supply, modern infrastructure and an intelligent transport system. But critics say the project is politically motivated and serves mainly to promote the government's image.",

    "title": "US envoy urges Sudan rivals to accept ceasefire plan – DW – 11/25/2025",
    "content": "Washington has been stepping up diplomatic pressure as its regional partners attempt to push Sudan's warring commanders toward a humanitarian truce after two years of conflict. US President Donald Trump's envoy for Africa, Massad Boulos, on Tuesday urged Sudan's rival commanders to accept an international ceasefire proposal \"without preconditions\" in a conflict that has devastated the country for more than two years. His appeal comes as diplomatic efforts intensify afterTrump said last week he would personally engage in efforts to end the war. The latest truce proposal, presented on behalf of the US, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, has not been released publicly. However, Sudanese army chief Abdel Fattah Burhan called it \"unacceptable,\" while his rival and former deputy,Rapid Support Forces (RSF)leader Mohamed Hamdane Daglo, announced a unilateral three-month humanitarian ceasefire on Monday. However, on Tuesday the army said it had fended off an attack on a base in Babanusa in West Kordofan state, the war's newest frontline. \"We are calling on both parties to accept the humanitarian truce as presented without preconditions,\" Boulos said in Abu Dhabi, adding that neither side had approved the text. \"We would like them to accept the specific text that was presented to them.\" Boulos spoke alongside Emirati presidential adviser Anwar Gargash, days after Burhan accused the mediation of bias because the UAE — widely accused of supporting the RSF — is part of the process. Abu Dhabi denies supplying weapons, fighters or fuel to the RSF despite evidence cited ininternational reports and independent investigations. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video On Sunday, Burhan had said the proposal transmitted by the US envoy was \"the worst,\" and claimed Boulos had adopted Emirati \"talking points.\" Boulos dismissed the accusation, saying Burhan was referring \"to something that does not exist\" and that he had \"no idea\" about. \"We need to ignore these comments and these remarks and focus on the essential issue, which is the humanitarian crisis,\" he added. Daglo had announced his unilateral truce \"in response to international efforts, particularly the initiative of President Donald Trump and the mediators.\" Earlier in November, the RSF had accepted the principle of a humanitarian truce proposed by mediators, but the army did not respond, and fighting has continued. Since April 2023, the war — marked by atrocities on both sides — has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions. The UN describes the situation as the world's \"worst humanitarian crisis.\" On Tuesday, Amnesty International accused the RSF of war crimes, including summary executions of unarmed men and sexual violence against women and girls duringthe group's recent capture of El-Fasher. The organization also denounced what it called Emirati \"support\" for the paramilitary force. Marit Maij, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, told DW that some of the weapons used by the RSF had been traced back to Europe through the UAE, and that an arms embargo on the UAE should be considered. \"We want to make sure if weapons are being produced in Europe, that these weapons are not being abused in these kinds of wars,\" Maij said. Over the past two years, Sudan's warring parties have violated subsequent ceasefire agreements,undermining multiple international negotiation efforts. Edited by: Jenipher Camino Gonzalez",

    "content": "Thailand's southern city of Hat Yai was particularly hard hit by floods, as officials said 33 people had died across nine provinces. Neighboring northern Malaysia was also forced to relocate thousands. Thailandairlifted patients out of Hat Yai in the southern Songkhla province on Wednesday, while flying in emergency equipment like oxygen tanks to treat the wounded, aftermajor floods hit the city. Several days oftorrential rainshave led to flooding in nine Thai provinces and eight states in neighboring Malaysia, displacing around 50,000 people in both countries. People took refuge on the rooftops and hospitals were flooded in Hat Yai, a commercial hub in southern Thailand, which saw 335 millimeters (roughly 13.2 inches) of rain in a single day, a 300-year record. Thailand's military mobilized some 200 boats, 20 helicopters and its only aircraft carrier to help with flood relief and rescue efforts. \"There have been 33 deaths across seven provinces,\" Thai government spokesman Siripong Angkasakulkiat said in Bangkok. \"Causes of death include being swept away by currents, drowning, electrocution, and landslides.\" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Provincial authorities said late on Wednesday on social media that the floodwaters were beginning to recede, but that strong currents were hindering rescue efforts. Military helicopters dropped equipment to residents gathered on rooftops, while other aircraft flew in key materials like generators, oxygen tanks and drinking water. The country's aircraft carrier, Chakri Narubet, set out from its home port on Tuesday to join the relief efforts, the navy said. The government also appealed to the public for the donation of useful relief equipment such as boats or Jet Skis. The Interior Ministry said that flooding across nine provinces, mainly in the south, had affected more than 980,000 homes or around 2.7 million people. Hat Yai's main hospital was inundated, forcing authorities to relocate around 600 patients, 50 of them in intensive care. The weather system that dumped a total of around 630 millimeters of rain on Hat Yai in the past days has moved away toward the Strait of Malacca and is expected to move towards Indonesia. Eight regions of neighboringMalaysiarecorded flooding, with forecasters predicting more rain in the coming days. The country moved more than 27,000 people to temporary shelthers this week, with one death recroded in Kelantan, one of the worst-hit states in the northeast. The country's monsoon season runs from November to March. The Foreign Ministry said that it was also monitoring the more severe flooding across the border, with thousands of Malaysian holidaymakers stranded in Thai hotels last week. \"Most of the affected Malaysians had been staying in multi-story hoteals and have been accounted for,\" the ministry said in a statement. As of Monday, it said, \"more than 6,300 Malaysians have safely crossed the border out of Thailand.\" To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser thatsupports HTML5 video Edited by Karl Sexton",

    "content": "Authorities are still searching for survivors after firefighters brought a blaze that has killed 75 people under control. Three people have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. Follow DW for more. This blog will bring you the latest on theHong Kong fireon Thursday November 27, 2025. Authorities inHong Konghave revised the death toll from the deadly fire which swept through the Wang Fuk Court housing estate, confirming on Thursday evening (local time) that at least 75 people have died. A 37-year-old firefighter and two Indonesians working as migrant domestic workers are reportedly among the dead. Earlier, Hong Kong city chief executive said 279 people were still missing but firefighters said they had established contact with some of them, leaving around 250 people still unaccounted for. Dozens of people were also being treated in hospital. A government spokesman told the AFP news agency that, as of Thursday, 12 were in a critical condition, 29 were listed as serious and 17 were stable. Firefighters said that four fires had been extinguished and three were under control, with flames still visible in some of the eight-building housing estate's almost 2,000 units well over 24 hours after the fire broke out. For the survivors who were safely able to evacuate the fires at the Wang Fuk Court, concerns remain about the fate of their homes and possessions — and loved ones who are still unaccounted for. \"When the fire started, I told her on the phone to escape,\" said Lawrence Lee, a resident who was waiting for news about his wife, who he believed was still trapped in their apartment. \"But once she left the flat, the corridor and stairs were all filled with smoke and it was all dark, so she had no choice but to go back to the flat.\" One distraught mother, who only gave her name as Ng, was searching for her daughter outside a shelter housing 900 residents, carrying her graduation photograph. \"She and her father are still not out yet,\" she sobbed. \"They didn't have water to save our building.\" Another 51-year-old resident surnamed Wan said she had bought an apartment in one of the buildings more than 20 years ago. \"All of our belongings were in this building and now it has all burned,\" she said. \"What's left?\" Hong Kongauthorities are yet to determine the precise cause of the devastating fire at the Wang Fuk Court estate, but the incident has shone a spotlight on the traditional use of bamboo scaffolding in the region. Bamboo played a key role in architecture and construction in mainlandChinafor centuries, reportedly even as far back as the building of the Great Wall. Cheap, abundant, flexible and strong, bamboo was also the material of choice for scaffolding in the former British colony of Hong Kong. Nowadays, in mainland China, bamboo scaffolding has largely been replaced by sturdier — and flame-resistant — metal constructions. Hong Kong, however, still has around 2,500 registered bamboo scaffolding masters, according to official figures. In March, Hong Kong's government said 50% of new public works contracts would be required to use metal scaffolding. But after 22 deaths involving bamboo scaffolders were recorded between 2019 and 2024, the reasoning was based more on worker safety than fire risk. In October, a massive bamboo scaffolding caught fire at the Chinachem Tower in downtown Hong Kong. Fire consumed construction netting and bamboo poles, leaving windows burnt out and external walls badly seared, but the building suffered no major structural damage. In aFacebookpost, the Association for the Rights of Industrial Accident Victims said there had been at least two other fires involving bamboo scaffolding in Hong Kong this year. Hong Kong Labour Department's Code of Practice for Bamboo Scaffolding Safety states that protective nets, screens and tarpaulins or plastic sheeting installed on the face of scaffolding \"should have appropriate fire retardant properties in compliance with a recognized standard.\" Police inHong Kongon Thursday searched the offices of the building maintenance company responsible for the Wang Fuk Court housing estate, seizing documents, employee lists, computers and mobile phones. \"We have reason to believe that the company’s responsible parties were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,\" said police superintendent Eileen Chung. Investigations are still ongoing, but the police superintendent suggested that foam sealant around some windows on the unaffected eighth Wang Fuk Court building may fall short of fire safety standards, as might protective mesh and plastic coverings. Two company directors and an engineering consultant working for an unspecified company have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter. The registered overall contractor for the complex, identified by Hong Kong's government as the Prestige Construction and Engineering Company Limited, has yet to comment. Hong KongChief Executive John Lee said on Thursday that the government would establish a HK$300 million ($38.57 million, €33.3 millino) fund to help the residents of the Wang Fuk Court housing estate, which was engulfed in flames on Wednesday. Lee said each housing unit would receive HK$10,000 ($1,285, €1,110) in immediate emergency funding on Thursday night and that the state would provide 1,000 rooms in hotels or youth hostels where residents can stay for up to two weeks. He also said the authorities would conduct inspections of large renovation works in the city and that up to 100 contractors would be given seven days to submit proof of their use of fire-retardant materials. The city's development bureau has also discussed gradually replacing bamboo scaffolding across the city with metal scaffolding, Lee said.

To the families, friends and communities, we stand with you. You are not alone.\" Seventy-two people were killed whenGrenfell Towerin the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea was engulfed by flames in 2017. The fire engulfed the Wang Fuk Court complex in Tai Po district, a northern suburb near the border with mainland China. The compound of eight buildings, each 31 floors high, has been occupied since 1983 under a government-subsidized home ownership scheme. As firefighters extinguished fires in some blocks and brought others under control, the scale of the devastation at Wang Fuk Court is becoming clear. Here are some of the latest images from the scene: Hong Kong'santi-corruption watchdog said on Thursday it has opened an investigation into renovation work at the housing complexwhere 55 people diedin a fire. \"In view of the immense public interest involved, the ICAC today set up a task force to launch a full investigation into possible corruption in the grand renovation project of Wang Fuk Court in Tai Po,\" the Independent Commission Against Corruption said in a statement. The devastating fire in a Hong Kong residential complexhas prompted several major Chinese companies and charitable groups to pledge millions of Hong Kong dollars in emergency assistance. The Jack Ma Foundation said it would provide HK$30 million ($3.86 million, €3.33 million) for emergency relief efforts. Sportswear firm 361 Degrees announced a contribution of HK$15 million in cash and supplies, while Anta Group pledged HK$30 million in cash and equipment for disaster relief. Footwear company Fuguiniao Group also committed aid of HK$5 million. TheRed Cross Societyof China said it would donate 2 million yuan ($280,000, €244,000) to support rescue operations on the ground. Meanwhile,Hong Kong residentsorganized their own aid for displaced residents and firefighters as crowds gathered in nearby streets and public areas in support. \"It's truly touching. The spirit of Hong Kong people is that when one is in trouble, everyone lends support... It shows that Hong Kong people are full of love,\" Stone Ngai, the organizer of an impromptu aid station, told the AFP news agency. The death toll from the massive fire that swept through aHong Kongresidential estate has risen to 55, the city's fire department said on Thursday. Officials told a news conference that 51 victims died at the scene and four later in hospital. Authorities said 72 people were injured. Fires in four of the estate's eight residential blocks have been extinguished, while three others are under control. One block was not affected.

As firefighters searchedHong Kong'sburning Wang Fuk Court complex for survivors, animal welfare volunteers swept in to rescue the estate's pets left behind. Dozens of workers arrived with oxygenated carriers and animal ambulances, negotiating with police toaccess the blazing building. \"Pet owners contacted our alliance and we compiled a list of more than 100 cases,\" said Anson Cheng, of the animal welfare group Hong Kong Guardians. \"We shared the cases with firefighters so that they can help check the flats and pick up the pets if they see them.\" By Thursday morning, at least 10 cats, seven dogs and several turtles had been saved, according to Cheng. As some residents wait anxiously for news of their pets, Hong Kong's pet microchipping system may help reunite them with survivors, Cheng added.  Several countries have offered their condolences to Hong Kong after the deadly fire. \"At this moment, let us join together in prayers for Hong Kong. I extend my deepest condolences to all Hong Kong friends who lost their lives in this disaster and to their families,\"TaiwanPresident Lai Ching-te said on X. The UK sent its \"heartfelt condolences\" to the people of Hong Kong. \"The horrendous fire in Tai Po apartment blocks is truly devastating and deeply distressing,\" UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said on X. The US consulate in Hong Kong has also reacted, saying they are \"deeply saddened by the tragic fire in Tai Po.\" \"Our thoughts are with the victims, their families and all those affected by this devastating fire,\" the consulate said.",

Four women and six men are involved in the incident, where they cut through a fence at the airport on July 13, 2023. Four of them then glued themselves near the runways. Eurowings, a subsidy of German flag-carrier Lufthansa, filed the lawsuit. The verdict was announced on Tuesday and can be appealed. If the defendants block an airport again, they can be detained for up to six months. Berlin will name the square in front of the state parliament afterHolocaust survivor Margot Friedländer, whodied in Mayat the age of 103, according to the DPA news agency. Friedländer, an honorary citizen of Berlin, will be commemorated at the entrance to the Berlin House of Representatives. Parliament President Cornelia Seibeld and Governing Mayor Kai Wegner have scheduled a press conference for Wednesday morning to announce the naming, DPA reported. Also attending will be Stefanie Remlinger, the mayor of Berlin-Mitte, where the parliament building is located. Federal Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil unveiled a special commemorative stamp honoring Friedländer on Tuesday, joined by representatives of the Jewish community and local students. Friedländer, born in 1921 to a Jewish family, survived deportation to the Theresienstadt concentration camp. After liberation, she emigrated to the United States with her husband. She returned to Berlin at age 88 and became aprominent eyewitness to the Holocaust, sharing her story in schools and public events. Her message — \"Be human\" — became her signature appeal.

Three British nationals heading back to the United Kingdom opened an emergency exit door on Saturday, setting off an alarm before being stopped by security staff. The day before, two Romanian passengers broke the glass on an emergency switch to force open a door after missing boarding for their flight to Bucharest. The men, aged 28 and 47, ran onto the apron but were detained by an airport security employee until federal police arrived. Criminal proceedings for trespassing have been launched against them. The three British travelers have not yet been charged. An airport spokesman said unauthorized use of emergency exits is strictly prohibited, adding that the airport is considering legal action. None of the passengers involved were allowed to board their flights.

Cross country skier Victoria Carl, part of Germany's gold medal-winning team in the last Winter Olympics in Beijing, has given up on participating in February's Games in Italy after failing a doping test earlier in the year. It's still not clear exactly what sanction Carl will face, but with just three months left until the Olympics and afterthe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)rejected a proposed compromise between Carl and Germany's NADA anti-doping agency, the 30-year-old said she assumed she would at least miss that event and the upcoming winter season. \"It is still difficult for me to accept that an oversight and a mistaken medical treatment is now leading to the collapse of my Olympic dream,\" Carl said. Carl failed a urine test in April of this year, with the case becoming public knowledge in the summer. She tested positive for clenbuterol, a medication used for respiratory problems like asthma that has regulatory approval in Europe but not in the US. It's a banned substance in sports because of perceived muscle-building and fat-burning qualities in higher doses. \"I was sick, I had powerful coughing fits and took the medication on doctor's instructions. I made everything public, I was not aware that it contained a prohibited substance,\" Carl said. Carl won gold with compatriot Katharina Henning in 2022 in the team cross country skiing, and also was part of the four-woman relay team that took silver. German cross country ski coach Peter Schlickenrieder said it was \"obviously bitter\" when an athlete's goal for which they had \"worked tirelessly over decades\" fell apart in this way. He had already said last month that he feared the 2030 Olympics, by which point Carl would be 34 years old, would be a more realistic goal for her to compete again. A court officer was killed while doing his work in Bexbach in the western state of Saarland early on Tuesday, the state Justice Ministry announced. The ministry did not immediately publish details of what happened, only saying that the 58-year-old man had been violently killed while on duty and pointing to ongoing investigations. The prosecution service in Saarbrücken also did not immediately comment further. Saarland's state premier, Anke Rehlinger, said she was deeply moved by \"this terrible news.\" \"As far as the details of the crime are concerned, everything necessary and required will be done to clarify the matter thoroughly and swiftly. Further information will be provided to you in due course,\" Rehlinger told reporters. Saarland's Justice Minister Petra Berg described the man—who worked in a role akin to a bailiff or marshal, to use British and American terminology—as a \"highly valued colleague\" in the state's legal system. The trial of seven alleged left-wing extremists, accused of aggravated assault and in some cases attempted murder committed in Germany and in Hungary, opened in the eastern German city of Dresden on Tuesday. They're accused of being part of a subset of the \"Antifa Ost\" extremist group, which wasrecently designated a foreign terrorist organization by the US, that called itself the \"Hammerbande\" or \"Hammer Gang.\" Six men and one woman, aged between 28 and 49, are in court, accused of membership in or support of a criminal group. Chief prosecutor Alexandra Geilhorn said while reading out the charges that they were \"methodical and organized\" in seeking out people they deemed to be right-wing extremists and attacking them. They often used hammers. In some cases, those attacked sustained severe injuries. The prosecution alleges that the group was formed by late 2017 or early 2018 at the latest, and that members were involved in eight attacks in Germany between 2018 and 2023 and several more in Hungary in 2023. The attacks in Hungary targeted participants in the far-right \"Day of Honor\" demonstration marking the failed February 1945 efforts of Nazi German and Hungarian troops to break the Soviet Red Army siege of Budapest in the latter stages of World War II. According to the Federal Prosecutor's Office, in some cases the defendants had at least \"accepted\" without remorse that the death of those attacked was a possibility. Supporters of the accused gathered both inside and outside the Dresden Upper District Court on Tuesday, with cries like \"Free all Antifas\" audible in the chamber. Court dates for the trial are currently scheduled through April of 2027. It's the second large prosecution of alleged Hammerbande members in recent years.Lina E. and three co-defendants were convicted in 2023. A man given a 9-year juvenile prison sentence last March for a 2022 homicide has been exonerated on appeal at the Traunstein District Court in Bavaria. Presiding judge Heike Will spoke of an \"unexpectedly fast end to proceedings\" on Tuesday, ruling there was insufficient evidence to convict the defendant of killing a female medical student identified as Hanna. This followed a psychologist declaring that the prosecution's star witness, an older inmate who had testified that the defendant, identified as Sebastian T., had admitted during a game of cards to killing Hanna, had not given credible testimony in the initial trial. Germany's highest federal court for such matters had declared a mistrial and called for a renewed hearing in Bavaria in response to this development in September. The prosecution also recommended the man's release, though it still believes that Hanna's death was homicide. Defense lawyers, meanwhile, argued that Sebastian T.'s innocence had again been demonstrated, after he had denied the murder at all stages of the trial. The young woman Hanna's body was found in the River Prien on October 3, 2022, after attending a disco in Aschau in the Bavarian Alps known as the\"Eiskeller\"or \"Ice Cellar.\" The defense argued accidental death was most likely, and that the wounds to her head and upper body were probably sustained as she was dragged several kilometers by the river's current. The defendant, now aged 23, had already been released from custody prior to the retrial. He had been convicted in March 2024. The court in Traunstein ordered that he be compensated for the 31 months spent in prison. German authorities searched properties across four states as they investigated a case concerning hundreds of emails threatening bomb attacks against schools, train stations and other public spaces. The raids in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, the northern state of Lower Saxony, and the central states of Saxony-Anhalt and Hesse, targeted four individuals, including two juveniles, police and prosecutors said. The suspects are accused of \"being responsible for hundreds of threatening emails with fake nationwide bomb threats against schools, central railway stations, shopping centers and other urban and public facilities.\" According to federal prosecutors, the aim of the emails was to \"disturb the public peace by threatening to commit criminal offenses... to trigger the greatest possible number of police operations and to create the greatest possible uncertainty among the population.\" The German economy stagnated in the third quarter of 2025 compared with the previous three months,data from the Federal Statistics Office (Destatis) showedTuesday. The data was consistent with an initial estimate. \"Economic activity was hampered in the third quarter by weak exports, while investments increased slightly,\" Destatis President Ruth Brand said in a statement. The German economy, as well as the broader euro zone economy, has been struggling, with quarterly GDP figures having been sluggish, and the country having recorded contractions in both 2023 and 2024. Experts say the US tariff shock and increased competition with China make things difficult for an export-oriented economy like Germany. In the third quarter of this year, the European Union and the USsigned a tariff agreement.

    "content": "An Afghan man who worked with US forces in Afghanistan is accused of a violent attack in Washington. He had been resettled in the US after the war.

Reid, wearing a t-shirt that says F*** Trump, F*** ICE, Free Palestine, Unoccupy Chicago, and a bunch of other messages which combined explain the dire strait in which the Democratic Party finds itself, casually claims that JD Vance will drop his “brown Hindu wife” Usha for “white queen” Erika Kirk. Karnataka's Congress faces a leadership showdown as the high command prepares to decide between chief minister Siddaramaiah and Deputy CM D.K. Shivakumar. Supporters of Shivakumar are pushing for a promised power-sharing deal, while Siddaramaiah aims to complete his full term. A decision is expected imminently, with three potential outcomes on the table. UAE has significantly curtailed visa issuance for Pakistanis, narrowly avoiding a complete passport ban. This move, reportedly due to concerns over criminal activities by visitors, has caused considerable difficulty for Pakistani nationals seeking entry. Meanwhile, UAE officials highlight visa facilitation reforms, processing hundreds of visas daily at a new center. Alibaba's CEO Eddie Wu dismisses AI bubble fears, planning aggressive investment despite Google's Sundar Pichai warning of \"irrationality\" and potential dotcom-like crash. Wu cites surging customer demand for AI resources, predicting shortages for three years, with Alibaba's Qwen app already exceeding 10 million downloads.  While Alibaba's profits dipped due to AI spending, its cloud division saw significant growth, prompting Wu to suggest their AI investment might be underestimated, contrasting with some internal skepticism. Karnataka's top Congress leaders, chief minister Siddaramaiah and deputy CM DK Shivakumar, engaged in a public spat on social media. Shivakumar alluded to a \"secret deal\" for a rotational chief ministership, while Siddaramaiah countered by emphasizing his commitment to a full five-year term and highlighting fulfilled promises. This open conflict signals a significant escalation beyond their supporters' verbal exchanges. Two US National Guard soldiers were critically wounded in a shooting near the White House, now being investigated as an act of terrorism by the FBI.

There is renewed optimism about the Indian stock markets - but is the current rally sustainable? Here's what experts have to say: The West Bengal School Service Commission has republished a “comprehensive” list of 1,806 tainted candidates today from the 2016 SLST, after the Calcutta High Court’s order. But while names, parents’ names, roll numbers and subjects are out, the schools they taught in remain hidden. The op-ed tracks nine years of rot in Bengal’s teacher recruitment scam, from SLST to Supreme Court. A man was rescued alive after being trapped for over 24 hours in a Hong Kong residential blaze that has claimed at least 65 lives. Emergency crews continue to battle the intense fire, facing structural dangers and extreme heat as they search for dozens still missing. Mark Cuban has cautioned major AI firms like OpenAI and Google against excessive spending in the race for the most powerful models. He likens the current AI arms race to the 1990s search engine boom, predicting a potential bubble and winner-take-all outcome. Cuban believes true disruption will emerge from unexpected breakthroughs, not just incremental improvements.

Winter's low sunlight hinders vital vitamin D production, impacting immunity and bone health. Experts advise smart sun exposure, prioritizing midday for brief periods, and considering skin tone. Since sunlight alone is often insufficient, incorporating vitamin D-rich foods and supplements, guided by medical advice, is crucial for maintaining optimal levels throughout the colder months. The BJP has accused the Congress of using social media accounts based outside India to shape domestic political narratives. Citing X's location-tracking features, BJP MP Sambit Patra alleged that several Congress-linked handles, including those of leaders and influencers, appear to be operating from countries like the US, Ireland, and Pakistan, pushing specific narratives against the government. The Assam Assembly has passed the Prohibition of Polygamy Bill, 2025, banning polygamous marriages across most of the state and imposing penalties for violations.

Hasina, in exile in New Delhi, denies the charges, calling them politically motivated. Delhi Capitals co-owner Parth Jindal anticipates the addition of one or two new teams to the Women's Premier League (WPL) soon.

    "title": "Blocked Arteries Symptoms: 'You can have 70% blocked arteries and still....', says vascular surgeon: 5 unnoticed warning signs of blocked arteries",
    "content": "\"You may have 70% blocked arteries and feel perfectly fine\", until one day the warning bells get loud. The arteries don't scream for help; they whisper. And most people turn a deaf ear to such whispers, mistaking them for ordinary tiredness, stress, or \"just getting older.\" Yet, these are your body's hints: five unnoticed warning signs of blocked arteries described in a natural, humanized perspective beyond textbook descriptions.Vascular surgeon Dr. Sumit Kapadia, with 18 years of experience, say that he has seen patients walk into OPD with no major symptoms, no alarming pains-only to discover the narrowing of arteries. Dr. Kapadia says, early screening is important, especially if you haveDiabetesHigh blood pressureFatigueHistory of smokingFamily history of vascular or heart-related diseases. When it comes to heart disease, regular screening is important This isn't the kind of tiredness you feel after a bad night's sleep or a long day at work. It's an odd, draining fatigue that shows up even when you've barely moved. Perhaps simple tasks, such as making the bed or walking across a room, leave you feeling spent. Women, in particular, often report this type of exhaustion before other symptoms appear, but it's easy to blame it on stress or hormones. When your arteries are blocked, the heart and muscles don't get enough oxygen, leaving your \"battery\" flat for no obvious reason. Blocked arteries don't always cause sharp pain. Sometimes it's just a weird pressure or heaviness-like a backpack strapped to your chest or a belt pulled too tight. You might notice it while walking quickly or climbing stairs, and it fades with rest. Many people describe the feeling as discomfort, rather than pain. This subtle sign happens when your heart muscle isn't getting the blood it needs. Never brush it off as \"heartburn\" or \"gas\"-get it checked, especially if you're at risk. You climb a few stairs or take a brisk walk and suddenly feel breathless, dizzy, or lightheaded. Sometimes, you may even notice it when lying flat in bed and struggling to catch your breath. That \"need to pause and recover\" feeling is common when arteries start to narrow. Some people get dizzy standing up, or after exercise, or even after sitting still. These symptoms can easily be mistaken for anemia, dehydration, or aging. But when they recur, don't ignore them-artery blockage could be quietly progressing underneath. Poor circulation often leaves noticeable marks on the body. Icy cold hands and feet, tingling, numbness, or wounds that take longer than usual to heal are classic early signs. Sometimes one leg, foot, hand, or even a single toe feels different from the other—colder, paler, weaker, or simply unusual. These symptoms are easy to dismiss, yet they indicate that blood may not be reaching your extremities properly. Persistent changes in skin color, temperature, or healing speed should never be ignored. They are especially important warning signals for people with diabetes, high blood pressure, or a family history of heart disease. Heart-related pain doesn’t always stay in the chest. It can radiate to the jaw, left arm, upper back, or even between the shoulder blades. Sometimes people feel unexplained dental pain, neck discomfort, or an ache in the arm that appears during physical activity. Because the body’s nerves are interconnected, the brain can misinterpret where the pain is coming from, making cardiac symptoms feel like something else entirely. If pain appears in unusual places—especially during exertion, stress, or with shortness of breath—it’s important to take it seriously and discuss it with a doctor to rule out heart-related causes. It so happens, that when the arteries are severely narrowed, often 80-90%, most people do not feel any chest pain, and this is why regular check ups are so imperative, especially for people with chronic illnesses, high cholesterol and a family history of heart diseases. Simple tests, recommended by Dr. Kapadia, are Ankle Brachial Pressure Index or Doppler, scans can catch these issues early, helping prevent serious problems before any symptoms appear or become apparent. Early detection through these screenings can be lifesaving, allowing timely interventions that protect your heart and overall health. Making these screenings a routine part of your healthcare can significantly reduce the risk of unexpected cardiac events. Heart damage can be kept at bay by consuming a healthy diet, and exercising Regular exercise plays a vital role in preventing and managing blocked arteries by improving blood flow, reducing inflammation, and helping lower cholesterol levels. When you move your body, through walking, cycling, or strength training, the heart pumps more efficiently, encouraging healthier arteries and preventing plaque from building up. Chest pain or pressure (angina) Shortness of breath Fatigue with minimal activity Dizziness or light-headedness",

    "title": "No more weak legs: 7 exercises for stronger calves",
    "content": "If you’re one of those who give up on meeting their 10,000 steps because they can’t drag their weak legs to walk for that long, this one’s for you. Calves are small but mighty. They help you walk, run, jump, and stand tall — yet are often neglected in workouts. Weak calves lead to tired legs, poor sprinting power, ankle instability, and even shin pain.  ​Cumin water works for weight loss? Yes jeera water helps, but not if you fall for these common myths​ If you’ve ever felt that your lower legs lack power or definition, in most cases, weak calves are the issue. They’re the perfect spoilsport, even when you have every intention to break away from the pattern of your sedentary lifestyle. Why? Because of the lack of strong calves, your legs won’t have the power to push you while working out. But here’s the paradoxical truth: only some specially targeted workouts can help you build stronger calves. The good news: you don’t need complicated equipment or hours at the gym to build stronger calves. Focused, consistent work that targets both parts of the calf muscle (the gastrocnemius and the deeper soleus) plus smart progressions will give you firmer, more powerful lower legs. Whether you want to improve your running, look better in shorts, reduce risk of injury, or climb stairs without puffing, these seven exercises, if done correctly, will transform weak calves into strong, reliable engines — because stronger calf muscles are more than just for show; in every walk of life, they’ll give you stability, balance, and overall mobility. This one targets the Gastrocnemius (primary), the large, bulging muscle. How to do it:Stand with feet hip-width on a raised edge (step or plate). Keep knees soft, chest up. Push through the balls of your feet to lift your heels as high as you can. Pause 1 second at the top, then slowly lower heels until you feel a stretch. Sets/reps:3–4 sets of 12–20 reps. Keep the tempo slow — 1s up, 1s pause, 2–3s down. Progression:Add dumbbells, barbell, or do single-leg variations when 20 reps become easy. This works on the Gastrocnemius, along with promoting balance and stability. How to do it:Stand on one foot on a step. Lightly touch a wall for balance only. Lift your heel as high as possible, pause, then lower slowly. Keep torso straight. Sets/reps:3 sets of 8–15 reps per leg. Focus on control while at it. Progression:Hold weight in the opposite hand or use a barbell for added load. This targets the Soleus (knee bent), the deeper, more endurance-minded muscle. How to do it:Sit with knees bent 90°. Keep feet flat on the floor. Raise heels by pressing into the balls of the feet, squeeze at the top, then lower slowly. If no machine, place a dumbbell on your knees or use a heavy household object. Sets/reps: 3–4 sets of 15–25 reps. In fact, the soleus responds better to higher reps. Progression:Increase weight or pause at the top for longer. This one helps build the Achilles tendon strength and promotes gastrocnemius control. How to do it:Stand on a raised edge on both feet, push up with both heels, then shift weight to one foot and lower very slowly (3–5 seconds) on that leg. Switch legs and keep going. Sets/reps:3 sets of 6–10 slow reps per leg. Progression:Increase the slow count; add a weighted backpack or dumbbell. This exercise helps in building calf endurance, fast-twitch fibers, and promoting coordination. How to do it:Keep knees slightly bent, jump on the balls of your feet with quick, light bounces. Use your wrists to turn the rope. Start short and steady. Sets/reps:5 rounds of 30–60 seconds with 30–60s rest. Progression:Increase duration slowly, add single-leg skipping, or double-unders when ready. This exercise does what it’s called: targets the calves while promoting grip and core stability. How to do it:Hold heavy dumbbells or kettlebells and walk forward on the balls of your feet for distance or time. Keep shoulders down and core braced. Sets/reps:3 rounds of 30–60 seconds or 20–40 meters. Progression:Increase weight or carry one heavier implement to challenge stability. This one is known for fuelling power and explosive calf strength (fast-twitch fibers). How to do it:Use a low-to-moderate box. Stand tall, explode upward using calves and hips, and land softly on the balls of your feet with knees slightly bent. Step down calmly. Sets/reps:3–5 sets of 4–8 reps. Always prioritize quality reps over quantity. Progression:Go for higher box, single-leg hops, or bounding drills. Strong legs play a key role in longevity because they support mobility, balance, and independence as you age. Research consistently shows that leg strength is closely linked to lower risk of falls, better metabolic health, and improved heart and bone function. When your legs stay strong, your body moves efficiently, circulates blood better, and maintains stability, all of which help you stay active, healthier, and independent for longer.

    "content": "Seven Maoists, including three women, were eliminated in a fierce encounter with police in Andhra Pradesh's Maredumilli region. The operation, continuing from Tuesday, resulted in the death of key leader Meturi Jokha Rao, alias Shankar, who was reportedly in charge of the Andhra Odisha Border region and specialized in technical aspects of arms and communication. The TTD trust board is launching a new police complaint to expose those behind the 2023 Parakamani scam and a questionable Lok Adalat settlement. This follows a reinvestigation order by the high court into the alleged theft of offerings by a mutt clerk. The board aims to uncover any past cover-ups and protect TTD's integrity. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu attributed the naming of Amaravati as the state capital to Lord Venkateswara Swamy. He performed Bhumi Puja for expansion works at the TTD Sri Venkateswara Swamy temple in Amaravati, praising the 29,000 farmers who contributed 33,000 acres for the capital's development. An illegal kidney transplant in Andhra Pradesh has led to the death of a 29-year-old woman and exposed a suspected organ trade network. Authorities sealed the unlicensed hospital, arresting 12 individuals, including two doctors, brokers, and government hospital staff. The victim was allegedly lured to sell her kidney for a meager sum.",
